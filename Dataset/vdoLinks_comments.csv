Barbet Schroeder's Maîtresse (1976), starring a youthful Gérard Depardieu and Bulle Ogier as leather-clad dominatrix Ariane, caused controversy with its graphic scenes of torture and fetishism. Originally confined to a handful of club cinemas upon its release, it was then given an 'X' certificate in 1981 after the BBFC requested a number of cuts. Released in a Dual Format Edition on 5 November 2012 by the BFI and presented uncut on DVD and, for the first time, on Blu-ray, Maîtresse is a stylish love story -- costumes are by Karl Lagerfeld -- with a dark undertone.

Available from Amazon: http://amzn.to/PKmqzZ

The release coincides with Uncut, a season at BFI Southbank that marks the centenary of the BBFC, which runs from 1 -- 30 November.

Rated PG

Starring:
Gene Wilder
Jill Clayburgh
Richard Pryor

Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor buy a first class ticket to comedy and murder.

The most hilarious suspense ride of your life!

In this wild comedy adventure, rail passenger George Caldwell (Gene Wilder) finds that a romantic escapade with a sultry secretary (Jill Clayburgh) puts him in the middle of a Hitchcockian murder plot. Leaping on and off the train, in and out of roomettes, bars and dining cars, George teams up with an amiable, small-time crook (Richard Pryor) to defy the murderer's henchmen, FBI agents and a host of other outrageous characters.

DukeBoyO1's 2 cents: This is a great movie which I have watched several times already in the last two day's that I've seen it (I found the DVD in our DVD rack), made 3/4th's a music video, and am putting the movie on my DS. =) But remember.. Nothing can stop, Silver Streak.
Go buy this movie it's great.=D Oh and Clifton James, the cop who goes, ""Don't shoot!"" Well, he was on the Dukes of Hazzard season two, episode 16, 'Treasure of Hazzard.' 

I do not own this movie, 20th Century Fox owns this great movie. If anyone has a problem with me uploading the trailer then tell me and I'll take it down immediatly.",167132,428,92,188,0,0.23798194444444443

ABbjHHOS6iQ,Original Theatrical Trailer | Brass Target | Warner Archive,"Brass Target (1978) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #BrassTarget

Who stole $250 million in Nazi gold? And who killed General George S. Patton to get away with it? A chilling suspense thriller, Brass Target makes the convincing case that these two actual events -- the theft of the bullion and Patton's death (""officially"" killed in an auto accident) -- were not coincidental. Was Patton assassinated? Grisly fact or engrossing fiction?

The all-star ""top brass"" cast includes Sophia Loren as a mysterious refugee, John Cassavetes as Maj. Joe De Luca, George Kennedy as Patton, Robert Vaughn as the mastermind behind the plot and Max von Sydow as a cold-blooded assassin. Based on an intriguing book by Frederick Nolan, Brass Target is ""a classy conspiracy thriller with one of those great blood-and-guts plots"" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). Brass Target takes aim and hits the mark for action-packed suspense.

Directed By John Hough
Starring Sophia Loren, John Cassavetes, Max von Sydow

Rockers is a 1978 Jamaican film by Ted Bafaloukos. Several popular reggae artists star in the movie, including Leroy ""Horsemouth"" Wallace, Burning Spear, Gregory Isaacs, Big Youth, Dillinger, and Jacob Miller.

Rockers was originally to be a documentary but blossomed into a full-length feature showing the reggae culture at its peak.

In this film, the culture, characters and mannerisms are authentic. The main rocker Leroy ""Horsemouth"" Wallace, for example, is shown living with his actual wife and kids and in his own home. The recording studios shown are the famous Harry J Studios where many roots reggae artists recorded during the 70s including Bob Marley. Samples of the film's dialogue were used in the early 1990's jungle track, ""Babylon"" by Splash.

This lyrical adaptation of the beloved Japanese novel by Junichiro Tanizaki was a late-career triumph for world-class director Kon Ichikawa. Revolving around the changing of the seasons, The Makioka Sisters (Sasame-yuki) follows the lives of four sisters who have taken on their family's kimono manufacturing business, over the course of a number of years leading up to the Pacific War. The two oldest have been married for some time, but according to tradition, the rebellious youngest sister cannot wed until the third, conservative and terribly shy, finds a husband.

England, 1931. A time of innocence and education, of hope and unity. Two teenagers establish a life-changing friendship at an elite public school and soon discover the omnipotent pressures that surround them to be equally energising as alienating.

Clever, flamboyant and gay, Guy is optimistic and stoic in his pursuit of a career in the diplomatic service.

Synopsis:
Ning Caichen (Leslie Cheung) is a lowly tax collector who takes refuge for the night at the spooky Lam Ro temple. There he encounters and promptly falls in love with a beautiful ghost named Nie Xiaoqian (Joey Wang). Unfortunately Xiaoqian is damned to serve the evil hermaphroditic tree spirit Lao Lao, who (thanks to an extraordinarily long tongue) feasts on the souls of amorous young males. Usually Xiaoqian, along with her comely sister Qing, tempts would-be Lotharios to their arboreal doom, but she too is smitten with the downtrodden wanderer. Soon afterwards, Caichen meets Master Yan (Ma Wu), a Taoist hermit, martial arts master, and a sworn enemy of Lao Lao, who tells him of Xiaoqian's true, otherworldly nature. Nonetheless, true love proves to be strong. Caichen promises Xiaoqian that he will help spring her from her dubious employment and Xiaoqian protects her love from the evil wood sprite. Later, things grow more complicated for the lovers when they learn that Xiaoqian has been betrothed to a demon warlord. ~AllRovi.com",140626,294,34,102,0,0.31373703703703704

elNCMX8EzAM,Monsieur Hire (DVD Trailer),"http://www.kino.com/video/item.php?film_id=886
Touching, lyrical, erotic, suspenseful and enigmatic, Patrice Leconte¹s (Girl on the Bridge) 1989 psychological drama Monsieur Hire is both ""a twisted love story and a tragic thriller"" (London Sunday Times). In a provincial French apartment block, Monsieur Hire (Michel Blanc) endures a solitary life of dulling work as a tailor and vitriolic scorn from his neighbors. Hire¹s only solace is an occasional night out bowling and the voyeuristic admiration of his neighbor, the ""ravishingly erotic"" (Entertainment Weekly) Alice (Sandrine Bonnaire ­ Vagabond, À Nos Amours), a beautiful, free-spirited woman conducting a heated love affair through un-drawn curtains across the way. But when police discover the nude body of another young woman in a nearby vacant lot, Hire becomes the prime suspect in a murder investigation that brings him face to face with the object of his desire even as it threatens to ensnare them both in a web of deceit, accusation, lust, and guilt.

Adapted from the book by celebrated Belgian crime novelist Georges Simenon, Monsieur Hire is a film of gorgeously muted widescreen color and ""funereal beauty"" (The Washington Post) that coolly unpacks sexual obsession and romantic love with an intelligence and understated intensity ""so delicate that you almost hold your breath for the last half-hour"" (Roger Ebert).",136004,194,19,121,0,0.28539444444444445

From acclaimed filmmaker and raconteur extraordinaire David Mamet (Heist) comes a provocative and gripping thriller about murder, loyalty and identity. Bobby Gold (Joe Mantegna, Criminal Minds) is a tough yet devoted cop who is thrust into the otherwise routine murder investigation of an elderly Jewish shopkeeper. What seems a straightforward case soon unravels to become a bewildering urban odyssey of intrigue and conspiracy as an underground movement of Zionist vigilantism and anti-Jewish activity threatens to unhinge Gold's own ideas of morality. The more involved he becomes in the case the more his judgment is clouded, bringing into question his loyalty to partner Sullivan (William H. Macy, Fargo). Also featuring Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction) and Rebecca Pidgeon (The Winslow Boy) Homicide is a taut, thought-provoking look at the underbelly of a ruthless and unforgiving world.",41898,168,15,133,0,-0.07924999999999999

Jilted by her boyfriend, Renata (Hunter), the oldest daughter of a close-knit Italian-American family, falls in love with Sam (Dreyfuss), an abrasive and forcefully charming businessman. But neither her spirited sister (Laura San Giacomo), her down-to-earth father (Danny Aiello), or her supportive mother (Gena Rowlands) can tolerate Sam's often obnoxious intrusion into their family circle. Aggressive and overwhelmingly generous, Sam proceeds - with only the best intentions - to disrupt and nearly demolish Renata's family. Love, humor and forgiveness go once more around as the Bellas try to balance Renata's happiness with their family's survival in this funny and often touching story, directed by Lasse Hallstrom.

His attention was drawn to Timofeev, a longtime clinic patient, an ex-convict suffering from an alternating personality. 

During periods of exacerbation of this disease, the patient considers himself a murderer of Alexander II and Nicholas II, Emperors of Russia. Doctor Smirnov takes an interest in this unique case and begins to actively study the unusual patient. Smirnov’s predecessor believed that “there are things in the human mind that are better never to be touched,” but the new doctor advocates a different treatment.

m4QTnENUl-4,Fist of Legend (Jing wu ying xiong) Trailer,"Jet Li stars in this historical Hong Kong action film, as Chen Zhen, a Chinese student in Japan in the 1920s. When his master is killed during the Japanese occupation of China, he returns to avenge his teacher's death. Back in China, he finds himself caught in the escalating racial tensions between the Chinese and the Japanese. The martial arts sequences in this 1994 film are handled more seriously than flashy acrobatics of other kung fu epics of the time and are perhaps a better showcase for Li's awe-inspiring fighting abilities. This story is inspired heavily by Bruce Lee's classic Fists of Fury.

Eine apokalyptische Komödie, schnell, grotesk, respektlos und intelligent: Wie aus dem Nichts taucht ein seltsamer Unbekannter in London auf. Wo immer er hinkommt, häufen sich groteske und mysteriöse Vorfälle, bis die Stadt im absurden Chaos zu versinken droht. Es ist der Tag der Sonnenfinsternis.

Eine apokalyptische Komödie von Ben Hopkins

The Nine Lives Of Tomas Katz
84 minutes, 
UK/Germany (2000), 
The second feature from British writer-director Ben Hopkins, this is a apocalyptic black comedy. Erratically executed, it still exudes eccentric inventiveness On the day of a solar eclipse, stranger Tomas Katz (the hugely versatile Fisher) materializes from a man-hole at the edge of the M25. Inexplicable powers enable this bizarrely-dressed individual to take on the identities of people he comes into contact with, and in these different guises - taxi-driver, government minister, London Underground controller, security guard - he wreaks havoc on a fast-disappearing metropolis.

Suddenly the Tube trains are carrying the souls of the dead to the Valley of Judgement, whilst the country has declared war on an obscure Pacific island. Only the mystical and blind Chief of the Metropolitan Police (McNeice) can foil Katz and prevent the end of the world by finding the legendary astral child.

The highly improvised The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz draws on a whole range of references and influences, including Monty Python, German expressionism, 'The Day Today', MTV pop videos, and Derek Jarman. Handsomely shot in black and white, there's evidence here of a fertile cinematic imagination on the part of Hopkins (whose previous feature, Simon Magus, was similarly shot through with the uncanny), enabling the spectator to view (and hear) London from a fresh perspective.

However, there's also a significant downside to the freewheeling style in the form of erratic pacing, ramshackle structure and woolly ideas, which result in the film becoming irritating, at times little more than a series of surreal set-pieces. The fact that the credits include a dedication to ""the bollards and windows of London"", gives some indication of the off-the-wall nature of the whole enterprise.",5779,44,4,60,0,0.04974999999999999

German historian and member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Klaus Muller interviews the dozen or so surviving victims, now frail and wizened, who recount their experiences. Jewish resistance fighter Gad Beck recalls how he posed as a Hitler Youth in an ultimately vain attempt at saving his lover. One man was freed from a sentence at Dachau only to be interned again a Buchenwald. Another recalls hearing, in the distance, a 'singing forest' -- the sound of gays bound and tortured by Nazis in a local grove. 

Epstein and Friedman fashion a layered narrative consisting not only of interviews but also archival footage depicting background life in Weimar Germany.",30144,149,10,135,0,-0.016833333333333325

Mini-serie para televisión, que adapta la famosa novela de Marion Zimmer Bradley sobre las leyendas artúricas. En ella se muestra cómo la vida del mítico rey Arturo estuvo siempre marcada por diferentes mujeres que le marcaron desde su infancia, siendo su tía, gran sacerdotisa de la isla de Avalon, el reino de las hadas. Este hecho marcaría su destino. Su tia Viviane, Gran Sacerdotisa de la isla de Avalón, dónde nació la antigüa religión de la Madre Diosa, decidió su nacimiento, su formación y, sin pretenderlo, su destino final. Su otra tía, Morgause, realizó un conjuro para que la reina fuera estéril. Su esposa Ginebra, enamorada de Lancelot, su mejor amigo, vivió atormentada por no darle un descendiente y, finalmente, su medio hermana Morgana, la mujer que más le amó, fue entregada en sacrificio al propio Rey para que engendrara de él un hijo sano y fuerte, aunque después, cuando descubrió quién fue su fugaz amante, nunca le reveló su secreto.

Directed by Jerzy Stuhr
SCREENPLAY BY KRZYSZTOF KIESLOWSKI 
Featuring Jerzy Stuhr, Anna Dymna, Rubio the camel

""When the camel lolls his jaws at dinnertime, or sways his Bactrian bulk, you may decide you've never seen anything quite so hilarious - or magnificent.""  
— New York Magazine

The Big Animal (Duze Zwierze), scripted by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski and shot in shimmering black-and-white by cinematographer Pawel Edelman (Academy Award nominee for Roman Polanski's The Pianist) is a lovely, small film that exposes greed and pettiness while celebrating the most beautiful human themes:  love, friendship and tolerance.

AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE FILM FESTIVAL 2000
NOMINEE, GRAND JURY PRIZE

READ MORE...

When the circus leaves town, Zygmunt Sawicki and his wife Marysia unwittingly adopt a camel into their family. The couple quickly forms a close bond with the nameless camel. At first the townspeople, too, are enthralled with the giant animal, since it is a welcome distraction from their everyday routine. As the bond between the couple and their camel grows stronger, the town-people suddenly begin to ostracize them...

Renowned filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (The Decalogue, Three Colors Trilogy) wrote the screenplay (based on the novel, Wielblad, by Kazimierz Orlos) in the 1970s, at the height of political oppression and social upheaval during the Communist era. This hothouse environment cultivated Poland's Cinema of Moral Anxiety and subversive criticism through the arts when it was difficult to speak openly. Mr. Kieslowki's friend Elzbieta Scotti safeguarded the script of The Big Animal.  After his death, he returned it to his widow.

SELECTED REVIEWS

""Mr. Stuhr, an actor who worked frequently with Kieslowski and who plays the main character in this film, honors his old friend's memory, producing a minor but nonetheless charming footnote to his oeuvre.""   — The New York Times

""The Big Animal is also a gift from the great beyond:  working from a recently-discovered, unfinished 1973 screenplay by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski, vet Polish actor-helmer Jerzy Stuhr...has made a rueful yet gentle fable about the price of individuality and the value of dignity... and will appeal to anyone old enough to read the subtitles."" — Variety

""An actor-turned-director, Stuhr appeared in many of Kieslowski's films and their partnership and friendship produced some stunning work. The Big Animal memorializes a complex man and his deceptively simple work, by a friend and colleague in a fitting tribute.""  —  Chicago Tribune 

""Gathers a sort of darkness as it comes to its oblique conclusion.""  — Boston Globe

""It is whimsical, bittersweet, wise in a minor key.""  — Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times

""This black-and-white movie features an enduring image: an ordinary couple at the dinner table with the giant, Dr. Seuss-like head of the camel ­filling their window ominously, ridiculously, like another dinner guest -- or like the proverbial elephant in the room that no one will address.""  — New York Daily News 

""The tale's faux-fable simplicity is cunningly eloquent.""  — Village Voice

It's back in 52 BC. That's right, BC. Although Gaul isn't totally overrun, Cleopatra's Egypt is under the yoke of the Roman Empire. What's worse is that Cleopatra, that dame with the big nose, has had the good sense to chose Caesar for her boyfriend. Caesar is the Emperor of the Greatest of All Peoples. Or so he says.

Bei is a less-than-successful exercise equipment salesman who yearns for excitement in his life. One day, Bei follows his instincts and trails two-suspicious-looking men into action and foils their plans. The resulting publicity from Bei's heroism brings him to the attention of a private investigator who informs him that he is actually the long-lost son of a wealthy businessman. Hoping to reunite with his true family, Bei travels to Korea where his father lies dying. Bei finds, to his astonishment, that both his parents lived the life he has longed for himself: they were both professional spies. Drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse where no one can be trusted, Bei travels to Turkey, where soon it's up to him to track down a new, highly addictive narcotic before it ends up in the hands of evil drug lords.

At first glance a souped-up Halloween haunted house, Hell Houses are modern-day fire-and-brimstone sermons replete with hundreds of actors, truck loads of lights and full audio-visual tech crews. In each room, visitors view depictions of school massacres, AIDS deaths, fatal drunk driving crashes, and botched abortions while demons goad the gullible sinners into doing their bidding and then cart their souls off to hell. With full access to the behind-the-scenes action, Hell House follows the process from the first script meeting until the last of the 13,000 visitors passes through the Hell House doors. The movie gives a window into the whole outrageous process of creating this over-the-top sermon, while showing an intimate portrait of the people who haunt this peculiar culture.",126203,265,48,108,0,-0.2866324324324324

Not long before his death, I created some comics interpretations of a few of Charles Bukowski's poems, with his knowledge and cooperation. Via Dennis P. Eichhorn, Buk provided me with poems to interpret. He endorsed and cashed every check. Most importantly, to me, he liked the comics, let me do another, etc. A few panels of our comics are shown in the movie. They are flashed by quickly in the trailer, but the drinking cartoons are from the comic book title called BIG MOUTH. Some of these books are still available here

Another Bukowski comic I illustrated appeared in ZERO ZERO issue one, from Fantagraphics. Another cartoon trivia note about the movie- Eichhorn has some original cartoon art, drawn by Bukowski himself, that appears at the end of the movie.

Washington Post journalist Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is skeptical about the process, feeling that it is just a way for the perpetrators to escape unscathed. Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an Afrikaaner poet and journalist, is enthusiastic, with great hopes of seeing her country healed. Instantly at odds over their opposing views, Langston and Anna are eventually drawn closer through the shared experience of listening to the moving and painful testimony. As Langston becomes increasingly drawn into Anna's world and her passion for the country of her birth, they both confront difficult questions.

R1-BbyYUVN8,Allan Arkush on FESTIVAL EXPRESS,"Director Bob Smeaton's rock 'n road-trip movie, featuring some of 1970's preeminent musicians on a five day train tour through Canada, is an essential time capsule of what happened when the swinging sixties made its awkward leap into the unforgiving after-party of the '70s. There are eye-opening run-ins with hostile fans along the way but the camaraderie of the musicians, including Janis Joplin, The Band and The Grateful Dead keeps spirits high (literally). Because the tour was a financial disaster, the footage sat unused in a garage for years before being resurrected for presentation at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival.",5733,40,4,288,0,0.6149749999999999

Nómadas, amor y terapia musical en un paraiso natural

El cine nos ha dejado a lo largo de su historia documentos que son un reflejo de nuestra vida humana y han sido realizados con una especial sensibilidad como lo demostró Robert Flaherty con su film etnográfico Nanuk el esquimal (1920-1922). En este aparentemente explorado planeta todavía hay muchos pueblos que conservan costumbres y tradiciones que se escapan del inventario del patrimonio cultural de la humanidad. Este es el caso de los pueblos nómadas que pululan por las estepas y desiertos de Mongolia. La historia del camello que llora explora los destinos de una familia de nómadas mongoleses y de los animales con los que conviven y sobreviven. Resulta insólito que una película de la red comercial pueda ser fruto del proyecto de unos estudiantes de la Escuela de Cine de Munich que se adentraron en el desierto de Mongolia, para buscar una historia maravillosa que fuera real pero que, a la vez, se pudiera contar casi sin palabras. El resultado final ha sido un film con una delicadeza y un respeto hacia sus personajes como hacía años no se lograba en el cine.",61346,226,8,120,0,-0.08280000000000001

gDe-uHsEMn8,Game Over-Kasparov And The Machine (2003)  FULL Documentary,"Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine is a 2003 documentary film by Vikram Jayanti about the match between Garry Kasparov, the highest rated chess player in history and the World Champion for 15 years (1985--2000), and Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer created by IBM. It was coproduced by Alliance Atlantis and the National Film Board of Canada.


Kasparov had beaten Deep Blue, a computer designed specifically to beat him, in a match played in 1996. He agreed to offer a rematch the following year. Kasparov won the first game of the rematch easily with the white pieces. In the second game, Kasparov was struggling with the black pieces, but set a trap that most computers fall for. Deep Blue didn't fall for it and won to level the match, although Kasparov and Deep Blue both missed a perpetual check that could have given Kasparov a draw. The next three matches ended in draws, with Kasparov appearing to weaken psychologically. Deep Blue went on to win the decisive sixth game, marking the first time in history that a computer defeated the World Champion in a match of several games.


Synopsis
From this experience, particularly the second game of the match, Kasparov accused the IBM team of cheating. He suspected that a human player was used during the games to improve the strategic strength of the computer. As a metaphor for this suspicion, the film weaves in the story of the Turk, a hoax involving a chess-playing automaton built in the eighteenth century, but secretly operated by human beings. The film also implies that Deep Blue's heavily promoted victory was a ploy by IBM to boost its market value.",191084,819,349,60,0,0.056844

Run by a lonely female ticket clerk and a young projectionist, the theater shows King Hu's 1967 martial arts epic Dragon Inn before darkening its screen forever. A sparse audience gathers--some attending to watch film, others attending in search of a connection. When a young Japanese tourist encounters someone with an uncanny resemblance to the swordsman in the film, we discover that comments about the theater's ghostly patrons may be more than rumors.""

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is Wes Anderson's fourth feature length film, released in the U.S. on December 25, 2004. It was written by Anderson and Noah Baumbach and was filmed in and around Naples, Ponza and the Italian Riviera.

The offbeat comedy stars Bill Murray as Steve Zissou, an eccentric oceanographer. In this ensemble cast, Steve Zissou sets out to exact revenge on the ""jaguar shark"" that ate his partner Esteban. Murray's character is both a parody of and homage to Jacques-Yves Cousteau, to whom the film is dedicated.

Rebels of the Neon God Official US Release Trailer 1 (2015) - Drama Movie HD

Tsai Ming-liang’s groundbreaking first feature, REBELS OF THE NEON GOD, already includes a handful of elements familiar to fans of subsequent work: a deceptively spare style often branded “minimalist;” actor Lee Kang-sheng as the silent and sullen Hsiao-kang; copious amounts of water, whether pouring from the sky or bubbling up from a clogged drain; and enough urban anomie to ensure that even the subtle humor in evidence is tinged with pathos. The loosely structured plot involves Hsiao-kang, a despondent cram school student, who becomes obsessed with young petty thief Ah-tze, after Ah-tze smashes the rearview mirror of a taxi driven by Hsiao-kang’s father. Hsiao-kang stalks Ah-tze and his buddy Ah-ping as they hang out in the film’s iconic arcade (featuring a telling poster of James Dean on the wall) and other locales around Taipei, and ultimately takes his revenge.",694721,668,28,122,0,0.28236363636363637

Chief of Scouts Ed Bannon narrowly avoids an Apache ambush while working with the cavalry stationed at Fort Clark, Texas. The US Army is trying to talk peace with the Apaches and move them to reservations in Florida, and they take Bannon's efforts as detrimental to their new policies, so they fire him. When the Apache chief's son Torinada returns from an Eastern education, Bannon becomes highly suspicious of his motives based run-ins with Torinada in the past. Bannon continues shadowing the proceedings to the chagrin of both the US Army and the Apache warrior.

Little (Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Marked for Death, Rapid Fire) and featuring make-up effects by Kevin Yagher (A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge, Face/Off), this “darker spin on…The Phantom of the Opera is the one to watch” (HorrorCultFilms.co.uk)!

vMIM-ma2juo,"Trailer LESSONS OF DARKNESS (Werner Herzog, 1992) - Festival de Cine 4+1","Werner Herzog: Invitado de Honor 2012, Festival de Cine 4+1

Al finalizar la Guerra del Golfo, y tras la retirada de las tropas, Herzog se adentra en los escenarios kuwaitíes del conflicto para filmar un paisaje tan inhóspito y desolador como poseedor de un inquietante y perverso atractivo: a la devastación bélica se suman los numerosos pozos de petróleo en llamas, torres de fuego que parecen emerger de la tierra creando un espectáculo sobrecogedor. Sobre ese telón de fondo, la cámara de Herzog narra varias cosas al mismo tiempo: las complejas y extremadamente peligrosas operaciones de extinción del fuego, la fractura sicológica y emocional que la guerra ha dejado en los habitantes, las dañinas consecuencias ecológicas que ha de afrontar Kuwait. Las imágenes se alzan hasta lo sublime, haciendo convivir en un mismo plano la belleza y el horror. Pese a la música que acompaña varios pasajes el silencio está siempre presente: como atestiguan una mujer y un niño, los propios habitantes han enmudecido. Ante semejante horror --viene a afirmar, en definitiva, la película-- no hay posibilidad de expresar nada. Y sólo cabe dar, una vez más, las gracias al director alemán por haber estado ahí para filmarlo. (Manuel Ferrari)
 -----------------------------------------
 Werner Herzog: Guest of Honor, 4+1 Film Festival 2012

At the end of the Gulf War, following the troops' withdrawal, Herzog travelled to Kuwait in order to explore this conflict in situ, filming a landscape as inhospitable and desolate as it is unnerving and perversely attractive: the devastation of war is exacerbated by the numerous oil wells in flames, towers of fire that appear to emerge from the earth, resulting in a deeply moving spectacle. With this backdrop, Herzog's camera narrates several stories at once: the complex and extremely dangerous operation of extinguishing these fires, the psychological and emotional scars the war has left on the country's inhabitants, and the harmful environmental consequences Kuwait must face. The images are often sublime, combining beauty and horror in a single shot. Despite the music used in several sequences, silence is ever-present: a woman and child serve to testify that even the inhabitants themselves have become mute. Ultimately the film affirms that it is impossible to express anything when faced with such horror. And, all we can do, once again, is thank the German director for having gone there to film it.

3KiEP5Ctfk0,The Nomi Song trailer,"The Nomi Song is Andrew Horn's award-winning look at the life of German-born singer Klaus Nomi. One of the most profoundly bizarre characters of the late 70s/early 80s New Wave underground scene, Klaus Nomi was a genuine counter-tenor who sang pop music like opera to enthusiastic club audiences. Through archival performance footage and interviews with his friends and fellow artists, Nomi's influence and unique style are brought to life twenty-two years after his death from AIDS.

Part documentary, part music film and part sci-fi, The Nomi Song is a story of love of music and love of performing at a time when it seemed as though everyone was struck by a sense of urgency to make something - anything. A time of no limits. Klaus Nomi was on the verge of international fame as a singer when he tragically became one of the first gay artists to die of AIDS (then referred to as the ""gay cancer""). He was as much a genuine talent as he was the engine of his own destruction. He was an alien amongst the outcasts and an obviously tortured soul who, at the same time, radiated optimism when optimism was ""officially"" out of fashion. The Nomi Song is a story that grows out of a group of people who influenced him; people who felt used, cheated yet, overall, inspired. Featuring Ann Magnuson, Gabriele Lafari, David MacDermot, Page Wood, Tony Frere, Man Parrish, Kristian Hoffman, Ron Johnsen, Kenny Scharf, Anthony Scibelli, Alan Platt with a special appearance by David Bowie.

The Nomi Song features the music of Wire, The Marbles, The Bongos, Pylon, The Mumps, Chi Pig, and, of course, David Bowie. This DVD also includes Klaus Nomi performances, many never before seen since originally performed by Klaus including a full performance of ""The Cold Song"" with full orchestra - Klaus's ultimate performance.

6orM84owB7M,Beautiful Boxer (2003) - Movie Trailer,"Rising even higher than the greatest expectations engendered by the International Press when it became a favorite of the film festivals, BEAUTIFUL BOXER is one of the more poetic, sensitive, luxuriously vivid and colorful films to come out of Thailand - and that is saying a lot, given the extravagant epics that yearly grow in popularity. This work of art is simply stunning in content, in direction, in acting, and in heartfelt simplicity of message. This is a great one! Writer/director Ekachai Uekrongtham based his first film on the true story of Parinaya Charoemphol AKA Nong Toom, a famous Thai athlete Muay Thai boxer (better known as 'kick boxer' - a demanding, dangerous sport) who entered the world of Muay Thai to garner enough money to help his family and pay for his ultimate sex-change surgery. A tough story to offer general audiences, perhaps, but Ekachai Uekrongtham presents this edgy biography with such cinematic finesse and care that it becomes a film that should appeal to a very wide audience. And much of that success is due to the towering performance by Asanee Suwan in his acting debut: Suwan is in life a professional kick boxer who won the title role after extensive auditions by many practitioners of Muay Thai.

BEAUTIFUL BOXER takes us through the life of Nong Toom, his childhood in a family of loving accepting parents who respect his love of beauty and things feminine, his brief period of being a monk who must leave the monastery because of his inclinations, through his introduction to makeup and play-acting women's roles in the Thai theaters, his ridicule as being more girl than boy (a fact that results in his parents' incarceration!), and his devoted friendship with a girl who supports his desire for femininity and a young man who stands up for him in the boys' camp for learning sports. Gradually Nong Toom realizes that the only way he can make enough money to achieve a sex change operation is to become a successful kick boxer and he aligns himself with a trainer Pi Chart (Sorapong Chatree) and with much commitment and practice becomes Thailand's most famous Muay Thai. His self-respect is further established when he openly wears makeup in the boxing ring, causing many to believe his act is a gimmick and not the manifestation of his true transsexualism. He fights the toughest opponents and wins consistently until he at last arrives in Toyko for the 'big purse' of fighting female wrestler Kyoko Inoue (who plays herself). With the money from the fight he is able to have his surgery and becomes the famous actress and model now living in Bangkok.

Under less sensitive eyes and minds this story could have become audacious, but instead the film elects to be sensitive to the transsexual conviction that Nong Toom is a woman trapped in a man's body, and it is the journey of self acceptance and personal victory that makes the story so deeply touching. Asanee Suwan, as a fine athlete, does all of his own fighting in the film and it is more choreography than brutality. He is amazing to watch and coupled with the fact that he is so wholly convincing in his fine acting that he makes this young transsexual utterly credible in movement, emotional density, and purity of vision is an extraordinary achievement.

Yes, the film has a few flaws of editing and other minor aspects, but the overwhelming power of the story more than compensates for those 'first film' learning curves. Highly recommended for ALL audiences, especially for those who fear there will be gratuitous physical scenes that might offend. There are none! Grady Harp

""Bette Davis gives a sharp, vital interpretation of Miss Moffat (the spinster teacher fighting to educate the poor children of a Welsh mining village)...by remaining true to its legitimate stage counterpart,"" said the Herald Tribune. The story, based on Emlyn Williams' autobiographical play, focuses on the relationship between Miss Moffat and her gifted young prodigy from the mines, Morgan Evans (John Dall). ""Consumed by inward fire, by the sheer joy of imparting knowledge"" (London Picture Post), she molds him into a legitimate candidate for an Oxford scholarship in the remarkably short span of two years. Despite the disaster of Morgan's seduction by trouble-making Bessie (Joan Lorring), the mutual struggle between teacher and pupil becomes a glorious triumph of the human spirit.

""Only Bette Davis...could have combated so successfully the obvious intention of the adaptors of the play to make frustrated sex the mainspring of the plot,"" observed Picture Post.

This is one of those movies you would not believe was real if you didn't see footage from it with your own eyes. A pre-Fast & Furious Paul Walker stars as a dorky teenager in love with a pre-WILD THINGS Denise Richards. This does not sit well with her violent boyfriend and Walker ends up getting chased into a nature preserve where a lion mauls him to death. Terry Kiser plays a mad scientist desperately in need of a brain to power the robot Tyrannosaurus Rex he's built for reasons that only make sense to him. Wackiness ensues.

A masterful interpretation of D.

Staying faithful to Lawrence's semi-autobiographical tale of life and love in a close-knit mining town in Northern England, Sons and Lovers includes great performances by Trevor Howard as gruff miner Walter, Wendy Hiller as his wife, Gertrude, and Dean Stockwell as their son Paul Morel, a sensitive, aspiring artist smothered by his mother, resenting his father, and unable to attain love with either the young devoted Miriam or the experienced Mrs. Dawes, a suffragette separated from her husband. Cardiff won a Golden Globe and a New York Film Critics award for his direction in addition to receiving an Oscar nomination for a film that remains the definitive adaptation of Lawrence's classic novel.",57386,140,12,156,0,-0.10642222222222222

9RNWy5VpL8Q,Digitally Remastered This Sporting Life,"Network is proud to bring THIS SPORTING LIFE (15) to DVD on 3rd November 2008, one of the most notable films from cinemas British New Wave phase. It is director Lindsay Andersons multi-award winning, gritty and powerful northern drama, featuring a breakout performance from Richard Harris (Gladiator, Harry Potter) with strong support from Rachel Roberts (Saturday Night Sunday Morning), both of whom are on tremendous form in one of the films that came to define the sixties. This version of the film has been taken from an HD print in the correct aspect ratio so this is the first time the film can be viewed on DVD as it was meant for a cinema audience.

Frank Machin is a miner who lodges with Mrs. Hammond, a widow. His competitive nature and powerful physique lead him to join the local rugby team. With a progressing sports career comes success  and perhaps a new sense of insecurity  which seems to make Frank harsher and cruder than he already is. But his inability to articulate his sensitive side only serves to alienate people further

With both Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts turning in powerhouse performances (which won Harris an award for Best Actor at Cannes and Roberts a nomination) plus a Palm dOr nomination at Cannes for director Lindsay Anderson, this is an unflinching look at the lives of the working class set in the bleak landscape of northern England.

Special features on this DVD are:
•Digital restoration of the film in the correct aspect ratio
•Original Theatrical Trailer
•Extensive image gallery
•Promotional and Script PDFs
•Commemorative Booklet by Film Historian and Lecturer David Rolinson.",41922,105,24,131,0,0.0893125

——

""Die wilden Papageien von Telegraph Hill"" ist ein mehrfach prämiertes Meisterwerk und berührt nicht nur durch seine Dokumentation über die Interaktion zwischen Mensch und Tier sondern auch durch die dahinter verborgene Liebesgeschichte, basierend auf einer wahren Begebenheit. Der Film handelt von der Beziehung eines ehemaligen Straßenmusikers und einem Schwarm wilder Papageien, die den Musiker ins Glück führen. Herzzerreißend offenbart ein Papagei nach dem anderen seinen ganz individuellen Charakter und bezaubert mit seiner eigenen Persönlichkeit.  Der Film erzielte in den USA das höchste inspielergebnis aller Tierdokumentationen und ist ein landesweiter Klassiker. Doch auch für die Dokumentarfilmerin Judy Irving hat dieser Film eine ganz besondere Bedeutung, denn er hat ihr Leben maßgeblich verändert. Ein Film für die ganze Familie, der die Sicht auf die Tiere in unserer unmittelbaren Umgebung weitet und zeigt, dass nichts ohne Grund geschieht bzw. präsent ist.

When Nazi troops seize his town, timid schoolmaster Albert Lory (Charles Laughton) submits to his new masters, although he cannot help but be inspired by the defiance of many of his fellow citizens. Then Albert is hauled before a tribunal, falsely accused of murder. Standing alone against the power of the Third Reich, this seemingly weak man then reveals an invincible soul. Three of cinema's most acclaimed talents -- Laughton, director Jean Renoir (Grand Illusion) and screenwriter Dudley Nichols (Stagecoach) -- unite for this moving portrait of the heroism of everyday men and women. The stellar cast includes Maureen O'Hara (Laughton's protégée and his The Hunchback of Notre Dame costar) as the colleague he secretly loves, George Sanders as a covert collaborator, and Walter Slezak as a wily Nazi officer who holds Albert's fate in his hands. ""A courageous film...a story cleanly and maturely told"" (Bosley Crowther, The New York Times).

Directed By Jean Renoir
Starring Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara, George Sanders

Nick Cave and David Field and Chris DeRose star in Ghosts...of the civil dead. 
The film is set in Central Industrial Prison, a maximum security prison in the middle of the desert. An outbreak of violence within the prison has resulted in a total lockdown. A committee is appointed by the prison's governors to investigate the cause of the outbreak, but their findings are in stark contrast to the facts behind the riot. As the viewers see, both the prisoners and the guards are slowly and deliberately brutalised, manipulated and provoked into the forthcoming eruption of violence, to justify the construction of a new and more ""secure"" facility.

Michael Powell, award-winning director of seminal classics Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes embarked on his final feature length film, returning to the themes and inspirations that established him as one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation.
 
Age of Consent explores the intense and often obsessive nature of an artist facing the sunset of his career - taking stock of his life and ultimate worth. James Mason (Lolita, The Verdict) is Bradley Morahan, a commercially successful but creatively jaded painter,  who retires from the bustle of New York to seek the tranquillity and peace of Australia's Great Barrier Reef.
 
Looking for inspiration, he meets an innocent yet mature teenager Cora (Oscar® winner Helen Mirren, The Queen, Red) who provides him with the impetus to paint once again. Exploring Cora's natural beauty, Bradley seeks to restore his creative drive and lift his battered self-esteem in a passionate and erotically charged encounter.
 
Based on the autobiographical novel by acclaimed artist Norman Lindsay, Age of Consent captures the essence of the artist as a tortured soul, the power of the mesmerising muse in lifting the spirit and launching the lifelong pursuit of beauty and happiness. Including a personal tribute by Martin Scorsese and a collection of insightful special features, Age of Consent is presented here in the original director's cut version.",158804,333,42,139,0,0.20706400000000003

Version Thomsoncolor, tournée conjointement avec le noir et blanc mais développée qu'en 1987.

rNbNqBVBsHA,Whisky - 2004 - Trailer,"Whisky is an Uruguayan tragicomedy film directed by Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll and released in 2004.[1] The film stars Andrés Pazos, Mirella Pascual, Jorge Bolani, Ana Katz, and Daniel Hendler. It was premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival where it won a Prix du Regard Original Award.

The film was well received by film critics and at the film festival it was screened. Critic Manohla Dargis, writing for the New York Times said, ""the film is a model of both fiscal and narrative economy, and the kind of work – gleaned from the mysteries of consciousness, telling quotidian details and a sense of aesthetic proportion – that is too often missing from American independent cinema.""

IMDB:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331370/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1


In 2001, a small film, 25 Watts, shot in black-and-white in 16mm for $200,000, won prizes at the festivals of Rotterdam, Buenos Aires and Havana, and got widely distributed. What was unusual was that the film was co-directed by two 26-year-olds, Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll, who came from Uruguay, a country hardly ever associated with cinema. Three years later, the duo had an even bigger success, with Whisky, and were busy writing a much-anticipated third screenplay when Rebella, aged 32, committed suicide.

Rebella and Stoll were both born in Montevideo, and got to know each other at the Catholic University of Montevideo when they were studying communications. They then both worked in publicity and television, co-writing and directing an animation series entitled El Service, and two acclaimed shorts, Buenos y Santos and Victor y los Elejidos. This led to the fresh and funny 25 Watts, which follows three young layabouts during a weekend in Monte-video, when they try to allay boredom by drinking beer, talking about girls and philosophising about life.

Offering reasons for their country's meagre cinematic output, Rebella and Stoll said: ""It is extremely difficult to produce a film in Uruguay because it is difficult to produce anything at all in Uruguay."" They also revealed, jokingly, that the only Uruguayan in the Guinness Book of Records is a man who clapped his hands non-stop for five days.

The wonderfully droll and award-winning Whisky consolidated their position and put Uruguay firmly on the cinematic map. Yet the directors only managed to scrape together enough money to make the film with the help of individuals and businesses from several countries.

An example of the production's hand-to-mouth existence was that the car driven by one of the main characters was sold to a junkyard during the eight-week shoot. ""Why, after a youthful and autobiographical film like 25 Watts, did we produce a film about two 60-year-old Jewish brothers, a woman and a stocking factory?"" asked Rebella. ""Well, as we wrote the script, we started to realise that perhaps these characters were not so different from ourselves; that we were not so far away from this kind of loneliness. They could be a projection of ourselves in 20 or 30 years time."" ""Whisky"" is the Uruguayan equivalent of saying ""cheese"" in front of a camera.

As their two features were both melancholy and funny, it is tempting to conclude that the tall, thin and dark Rebella contributed the former aspect while the shorter, blond and stocky Stoll supplied the humour. A few weeks ago, Rebella sent some pages of the new script to the producer. He also announced his intention to go, with Stoll, to the Locarno film festival in August. However, in the early hours of July 14, he was discovered by his girlfriend and Stoll in his apartment in downtown Montevideo, sitting in a chair, in front of his computer, with a gunshot to his head and a .32 gun beside him. He had apparently consumed half a bottle of whisky.",77530,325,63,115,0,-0.04465

The Amityville Horror is a 2005 American horror film directed by Andrew Douglas. The screenplay by Scott Kosar and Sandor Stern is based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Jay Anson, which was inspired by a real-life November 1974 incident in which Ronald DeFeo, Jr. shot dead six members of his family in their Long Island home.

The film is a remake of a 1979 screen adaptation that spawned several sequels that had little to do with the original story.
***************************
STORY PLOT
George and Kathy Lutz and her three children from a previous marriage move into what they believe will be their dream home, 412 Ocean Avenue situated on the waterfront in Amityville, New York. When George questions the asking price, which is well below market value, the realtor confesses the house was the scene of a brutal murder committed by Ronald DeFeo, the son of the former owners, who killed his family in their sleep with a rifle a year earlier. Despite some misgivings, George acquiesces to his wife's wishes and purchases the property.",329009,488,56,151,0,0.1587175

In 1942, a recruiter from one such Napola sets his sights on Friedrich, a talented adolescent boxer, who sees the training and prestige offered by the Napola as his ticket out of an impoverished family unit run by his anti-Nazi father.

In the Napola, Friedrich learns to fight without pity, becoming a formidable killing machine. Propagandistic classes reinforce a hardened worldview of his Aryan superiority.

Meanwhile, Friedrich forms a bond with fellow cadet Albrecht Stein, an aspiring writer and son of the local Nazi governor. Governor Stein dotes on Friedrich, barely masking his contempt for his own son's sensitivity. But Friedrich admires and empathizes with his friend, even though Albrecht criticizes Friedrich's brutality in the ring.

As the war escalates, the school's military training also intensifies. Unscrupulous trainers humiliate the more vulnerable cadets in front of their peers and send the others out on dubious war game exercises. In one such nightmarish event, they instruct Friedrich and Albrecht to shoot escaping POW's who turn out to be unarmed Russian civilians. Tormented with guilt, Albrecht rebels, and Friedrich must choose between his sworn allegiance to the Fuehrer and his best friend's moral imperative.",303827,493,78,98,0,0.15216756756756758

JTZwKbJgoDk,KES - Brand New Masters of Cinema Trailer (SD version),"One of the most beloved and iconic British films of all time (voted in the top 10 of all time by the British Film Institute), Ken Loach’s breakthrough cinematic feature Kes is a cornerstone of naturalistic filmmaking whose influence is felt up to the present day.
 
Portraying with remarkable detail and empathy the day-to-day existence of a working-class 15-year-old boy in Barnsley (an unforgettable performance by David Bradley), and the profound change that the rearing of a kestrel brings to his otherwise troubled home life, Kes has enchanted generations of viewers since its release.
 
A rich, gently poetic work, filled with Loach’s trademark respect for his characters and astonishing skill at eliciting outstanding performances, The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present the film in a definitive Blu-ray special edition.

MjPz3sLWMgs,"""Unconscious"" trailer","Trailer for the film ""Unconscious""

From acclaimed Spanish director Joaquín Oristrell, Unconscious is a delightful period comedy that questions sexual taboos in Barcelona in the early 20th century, yet resonates with a modern sensibility. With the beginnings of psychoanalysis and a visit from Freud as a leitmotiv and background, brother and sister-in-law Salvador and Alma become involved in a search for her missing husband.  Hypnosis, love, danger, and every imaginable taboo are intertwined.

Leonor Watling (Bad Education) is simply outstanding as nine-months pregnant Alma, a neurotic yet lovable character.  As the love-struck Salvador, Luis Tosar (Miami Vice) confirms himself as one of Spain's greatest actors. The couple's chemistry helps make this film a rare and special treasure.

Released by National Archives and Records Administration

December 7th (Long Version)

According to the Amazon.Com description: In 1943 John Ford gave the great cinematographer Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane, The Grapes of Wrath) an opportunity to direct his first film. What was intended to be a short documentary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor grew into a veritable epic, framed by a debate between Walter Huston's Uncle Sam and Harry Davenport's Mr. C on the true nature of the Pacific paradise. Hawaiian history, rah-rah patriotism, and arguments over the loyalty of the Japanese-American population are capped by a stunning re-creation of the battle so convincing that feature films borrowed footage from it for decades. Arch and dated, it's a fascinating slice of history that until a few years ago was never seen by the public. Toland's criticisms of the American Navy caused it to be withheld until Ford could cut the 82-minute feature into a half-hour short, removing the history and analysis and concentrating solely on the battle and the recovery.",47770,222,20,60,0,0.09215333333333334

On top of that, he has a beautiful model wife named Sonja Slowinski, although many within his social circle don't see her as being a good influence on him. But Frankie has disappeared from the Ibiza club scene now for a year, with most only speculating that his life has degenerated into squalor based on his excessive lifestyle in Ibiza. In reality, Frankie's current disappearance and his ultimate fate is due in part to his excessive substance abuse, especially of cocaine, but also partly due to exposure to continual loud music and a physical disorder: he went completely deaf, with no possibility of getting his hearing back. As he went from partial hearing to total deafness, Frankie believed he could still eke out a living as a DJ without telling many of his descent into total deafness...

Sixteen-year-old Poppy (Emma Roberts) is a self-obsessed, incorrigible brat who lives a pampered life in her L.A. world. Though she's handed credit cards with unlimited balances and surrounded by countless hangers on, Poppy can't escape the mounting frustration she feels with her family situation. And she makes sure that everyone knows it. 

After an over-the-top prank pushes her father (Aidan Quinn) one step too far, Poppy is shipped off to an English boarding school.

Under the watchful eye of the school's headmistress (Natasha Richardson) and surrounded by a new circle of friends, Poppy begrudgingly realizes her bad-girl behavior will only get her so far.

9yCONEdFgWo,Shadow Company Official Full Documentary,"In the late 20th Century the distinction between soldier and mercenary became blurred. The recent use of private military companies (PMCs) in Iraq has been more extensive than at any time in modern history. The brutal killing of four PMC employees in Fallujah in April 2004 made it clear that these “contractors” are not merely workers in a foreign land. But are the lives of such men the only thing at risk when we privatize warfare?

Shadow Company explores the moral and ethical issues private military solutions create for PMC employees, for the Western governments who foot the bill for their salaries, and for everyday citizens like you. The filmmakers traveled the globe to expose all sides of the issue, interviewing PMC staff, owners and lobbyists, former mercenaries, academics, journalists and top authors. So what is really at risk? See the movie and decide for yourself.

(also check the original graphic novel about Executive Outcomes at http://www.executiveoutcomesthemovie.com)

""Takes a thorough and balanced look at the use of private security forces in Iraq and raises serious policy questions,""
U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA)

“Great job.  Covers a controversial issue in an evenhanded fashion.”
Colonel Thomas X. Hammes, USMC (retired)

""Shadow Company is a must-see film for anyone who is concerned about our military and our security being privatized.""
Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL)

”In addition to being extremely well-executed, I thought its even-handed tone was particularly sophisticated - encouraging an audience to consider the complexity of the issue, rather than the more exploitative depictions with which the subject is usually treated”

aQF2PfPIGbY,Michael Schlesinger on SATAN MET A LADY,"This 1936 production is the second film to have been based on Dashiell Hammett’s 1930 The Maltese Falcon and although the names have been changed, the crimes remain the same… though this time the object of interest is not a jewel-encrusted falcon but a ram’s head filled with gems. Warner Bros. assigned Bette Davis to this right after The Petrified Forest and the feisty actress was so appalled by the script she walked off the set. John Huston and company did it right (really right) five years later and the rest is movie history.

So I'm promoting this movie like crazy!!

Synopsis:
In the 1930s, Foshan thrives as the hub of Chinese wushu, with various sects actively recruiting disciples. They often compete against each other to prove their strengths. 

While Yip Man is an accomplished martial artist, he is unassuming and keeps a low-profile, and doesn't run any martial arts school nor accept students. He only stays at home, quietly sparring with his compatriots in friendly competitions, swapping pointers with each other.

One day, Yip Man (Donnie Yen) is challenged by Master Liao (Chen Zhi Hui), who just set up a wushu school, in a closed match. Yip Man's buddy Martial Zealot Lin (Xing Yu), who witnessed the entire fight, tells everyone about Master Liu losing. Seeing it as a public humiliation, Master Liao gets into disputes with Yip Man.

Henchmen of Jin Shan Zhao (Fan Siu Wong) are going around challenging various wushu schools in Foshan. In one fight, Martial Zealot Lin is mortally wounded. Yip Man comes to his rescue, only to be stopped by Jin Shan Zhao. Everyone gathers around to watch the match whereby Ip Man dispenses the latter with ease using four Wing Chun Forms: fist, footwork, blade and cudgel.

Ip Man becomes an instant hero and there develops a craze for Wing Chun in Foshan. 

Following Japanese invasion in 1937, everyone's life is adversely affected. Yip Man's property is confiscated and his family is forced to live in a decrepit house. Being one with strong pride, Ip Man refuses charity from his wealthy friend Zhou Qing Quan (Simon Yam), owner of a cotton mill, opting instead to work as a coolie at a coal mine to sustain his family. 

One day, General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), together with his troops, arrives. As a fanatical practitioner in martial arts himself, he sets up an arena, offering rice as a reward. However, to another high-ranking Japanese officer Sato's (Shibuya Tenma) mind, they cannot afford to lose, they must preserve Japanese superiority and dignity. 

Eagerly taking up the challenge, Martial Zealot Lin makes use of the opportunity to demean the Japanese...

JbPufXnFOh8,Battle in Seattle - trailer,"November 1999, and five days are about to rock the world as tens of thousands of demonstrators take to the streets of Seattle in protest of the World Trade Organization&rsquo;s Ministerial Meeting. Among them are Django (Andre Benjamin), Sam (Jennifer Carpenter), Lou (Michelle Rodriguez) and Jay (Martin Henderson). Each has a unique story, but they&rsquo;re united in a common desire to be heard and to make a difference in the world. For these four protesters, this is very personal and the stakes are higher than mere politics. 

A peaceful demonstration to stop the WTO talks quickly escalates into a full-scale riot, and soon a State of Emergency is declared by the Mayor of Seattle. The streets are mayhem, and the WTO is paralyzed. Caught in the crossfire of civil liberties and keeping the peace are Seattle residents, including its beleaguered mayor (Ray Liotta), a riot cop on the streets (Woody Harrelson) and his pregnant wife (Charlize Theron). The choices they all make will change their lives forever.

Writer/Director Stuart Townsend brings together this talented ensemble to intertwine different points of view &ndash; from protesters and police to delegates and doctors -- each of whom intentionally or accidentally find themselves on the streets of Seattle in those last days of the millennium. Townsend seamlessly merges footage of the real event with his fictional narrative. Ultimately, Battle in Seattle illustrates that even against incredible odds, ordinary people can change the world.",379807,594,225,149,0,-0.14038

The early years of the war are seen from the perspective of the United States, with particular focus on the reluctance of the American people to get involved in a European or Asian conflict. As the German army rolls across Europe, Nazi organizations spring up across the United States. The film attributes the rise of such groups to Hitler's policy of softening up future targets with political sympathizers, and shows one surreal Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden, where paintings of
George Washington hang alongside the swastika. Eventually the American government realizes that war is inevitable and cranks up the production of weapons and drafts the largest army in its history. The film ends with the war's beginning for the United States, the surprise attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941.",57353,277,109,60,0,0.034141860465116275

As the banlieues of Paris burn due to riots protesting the election triumph of an extreme right-wing party, a group of youths uses the chaos as cover for smash-and-grab robberies. For Yasmina (Karina Testa), the money is an escape from the slums she has known all her life. With the police on their tail, her gang splits up, planning to meet at an inn near the Luxembourg border. Arriving at their destination, they encounter their hosts, the Von Geisler clan, who seem to be stuck in time: a jackbooted patriarch, his savagely flirtatious daughters, and his thuggish sons. Revealing themselves as neo-Nazi fanatics, they see Yasmina as a fresh bloodline for their fascistic fantasy of starting a new Aryan brotherhood. Her friends find themselves trapped in a grim abattoir as Yasmina fights against the Von Geisler's invitation to become 'one of the family' in their twisted Gothic household.

Genius provocateur Nagisa Oshima made one of his most startling political statements with the compelling pitch-black satire DEATH BY HANGING. In this macabre farce, a Korean man is sentenced to death in Japan but survives his execution, sending the authorities into a panic about what to do next. 

It’s been nearly fifty years since the film's original release, yet the 1968 feature remains as viscerally powerful as ever. Oshima, one of the Japanese New Wave’s most prominent directors, made the film as a satirical examination of capital punishment. This powerful work, out this week on Blu-ray and DVD, walks the the line between haunting case study and farcical portrayal of a flawed justice system. In honor of its new release, check out the film’s documentary-esque original trailer, featuring an impassioned cry by Oshima himself for the film’s social and political importance.",112096,900,22,250,0,0.24153333333333332

Architect-turned-filmmaker Patrick Keiller expands and inventively redefines the documentary format in this unique ""travelogue"" of England. Using immaculately composed shots, he presents the country's familiar historic landmarks and grand estates, but also the suburban malls, industrial parks, landfills, factories, and phone booths choking the landscape. A bit of witty and droll humor is introduced through the commentary of the offscreen narrator (veteran actor Paul Scofield), who travels, explores, and examines the country with his friend, Robinson. ""Robinson advances Keiller's claim to be the liveliest spark of the British independent scene, and the wittiest film essayist since the early Peter Greenaway"" (The Times).

Against the advice of police and cautions from the locals, Clay pursues what few leads he has in the search for his missing sister, Whitney, with the help of Jenna, a young woman he meets among a group of college kids up for an all-thrills weekend. But they are all about to find much more than they bargained for.

What in Hell is going on at Headstone Manor? In this hilarious spoof of every horror fan's favourite films, a team of mad scientists, led by Dr. Lukas Mandeville (Kenny Everett) and his assistant Dr. Barbara Coyle (Pamela Stephenson) are investigating paranormal phenomena in the mysterious manor. Unknown to the scientists, their presence is about to incur the wrath of a local coven of bumbling but determined Satanists led by a 700-year-old disciple of the Devil known only as the Sinister Man (Vincent Price), all of whom are prepared to stop at nothing in purging the house of the unwelcome intruders.

Scripted by Barry Cryer (The Two Ronnies; The Kenny Everett Television Show), BLOODBATH AT THE HOUSE OF DEATH is a killer mixture of gross-out horror, shameless Carry On-style comedy and more than a little bit of kitsch zaniness. It revels in its merciless parodies of a lengthy checklist of horror and genre movies such as Alien, The Entity, Carrie, An American Werewolf in London, Jaws and The Shining.

Never before released on DVD anywhere in the world and now remastered from the original vault negatives, BLOODBATH AT THE HOUSE OF DEATH stars a whole host of familiar faces from British film and television including influential radio DJ and comedian Kenny Everett, Pamela Stephenson (Superman III; Not the Nine O'Clock News), Gareth Hunt (The New Avengers), Don Warrington (Grange Hill; Rising Damp), John Fortune (Bremner, Bird and Fortune), Sheila Steafel (The Ghosts of Motley Hall), Cleo Rocos (The Kenny Everett Television Show; Celebrity Big Brother), Graham Stark (the Pink Panther movies) and horror legend, Vincent Price.

The man who understands them is also their hunter: the head of the German police force Horst Herold (Bruno Ganz). And while he succeeds in his relentless pursuit of the young terrorists, he knows hes only dealing with the tip of the iceberg.

We all know opposites attract...but is the grass always greener?

Meet Brett and Tash.

Brett (Guy Pearce-Memento, The Time Machine) is good-looking, confident and perhaps a tad on the egotistical side. Tash (Claudia Karvan - The Secret Life of Us) is intellectual and reserved, but maybe a little too smart for her own good.

When these two meet it's love at first sight, but when a lack of compromise threatens to break-up their relationship, the natural forces of the universe intervene.

Brett and Tash wake up - in each others body! The stage is set for an hilarious Aussie romantic comedy that takes the battle of the sexes to a brand new frontline.

Star of Midnight shines in the stylish tradition of Hollywood's Thin Man series, combining the spunk and sparkle of Ginger Rogers and the urbane sophistication of William Powell with gals, gangsters, Broadway and banter to shape a classic '30s whodunit. Powell is a debonair lawyer suspected in the murder of a nosy newspaper columnist. Aided by classy, sassy, marriage-minded Rogers, he untangles the Manhattan maze of double-crosses, disguises and misdirections without disarranging his dinner jacket -- or bruising his gin. Martinis all around if you solve the mystery first!

Directed By Stephen Roberts
Starring William Powell, Ginger Rogers, Paul Kelly

Living in rural America, The Kimbrough family is a normally odd bunch; Easy, the patriarch, owns a butcher shop and finds himself grieving over the loss of his wife, Ceci, while hiding a secret ongoing relationship for years; Beagle, his youngest son who was left to care for his ailing mother, works in the local high school cafeteria by day but has a burning passion inside that manifests itself through painting; and the eldest son, Guy, has been away from the family for years while pursuing his musical aspirations in the big city until the day he learns of his mothers passing and that hes missed the funeral.

Upon Guys return home, the complex nature of each character unravels; Beagles pent up emotions connect with Georgia Kaminski, a terminally ill teenage girl wanting to experience love before its too late; Easys long time affair with Marg, Georgias eccentric grandmother, is exposed to the Kimbrough family; and Guy discovers that, in his absence, his high school sweetheart, Stephanie, has moved on and started a family of her own.

Through it all, The Kimbroughs and Kaminskis manage to establish a new beginning in the face of their greatest fears; life, death and family...",1028969,1179,410,107,0,0.151034

Bien qu'il ait peu écrit d'œuvres classiques, George Gershwin est sans doute le compositeur dont les œuvres sont les plus souvent jouées. Chacun connaît  sa « Rhapsody in Bleue » (1924 ; orchestrée par Ferdé Grofé), son superbe « Concerto pour piano et orchestre en fa majeur » (1927),  son poème symphonique « Un Américain à Paris » (1928) dans lequel il a intégré des klaxons français, ses « Variations sur  ""I Got Rythm » (1934) pour piano et orchestre, sa pittoresque « Ouverture Cubaine » (1932) et... son opéra folk « Porgy and Bess », composé en 1935, dans lequel Gershwin essaya d'être le plus authentique possible vis-à-vis des Noirs américains et de leur musique. Il existe de nombreuses versions de cet opéra qui, toutes, magnifient les airs inventés par Gershwin, mais, précisément, ces belles voix ne se donnent-elles pas trop d'importance au détriment de l'authenticité recherchée par l'auteur ? Aussi l'on peut préférer l'interprétation qu'en a donné André Prévin pour le film d'Otto Preminger « Porgy and Bess », réalisé en 1959. Les voix y sont naturelles et ne cherchent jamais à briller pour elles-mêmes : elles restent au service d'une histoire et sont celles de personnages communs. Sans doute est-ce avant tout cette spontanéité et cette fraîcheur que recherchait George Gershwin et son frère Ira, parolier. Connu pour être un grand chef d'orchestre et un bon compositeur de musique de film, André Prévin a arrangé et dirigé cette interprétation dont nous écoutons ici les grands moments. On peut aussi apprécier de George Gershwin, sur collectionCB, sa « Second Rhapsody, for piano and orchestra » (1932).

With razor-sharp, truly laugh-out-loud dialogue the film pokes fun at the absurdity and ineptitude of our highest leaders. With everyone looking out for number one, and the fate of the free world at stake (but apparently incidental), the hilarious ensemble cast of characters bumbles its way through Machiavellian political dealings, across continents, and toward comic resolutions that are unforeseeable.

Coming to theaters on November 13, 2009.
Starring: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Sturridge, Talulah Riley

Pirate Radio is the newest ensemble comedy from filmmaker Richard Curtis (screenwriter of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, and writer/director of Love Actually), spinning the irreverent yet fact-based tale of a seafaring band of rogue rock and roll deejays whose pirate radio captivated and inspired 1960s Britain. Playing the music that rocked a nation and a decade, the group boldly and hilariously defies the government that tries to shut them down. Broadcasting live 24/7 from an old tanker anchored in the middle of the North Sea (just beyond British jurisdiction), Radio Rock sends out a vibrant and unifying signal to millions across the nation, ranging in age from wide-eyed pre-teens secretly tuning in long past their bedtimes to everyday people in need of a musical pick-me-up. The Radio Rock roster, overseen by unflappable station owner (and ships captain) Quentin (Bill Nighy), includes a risk-prone American known only as The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman); mystic deejay royalty Gavin (Rhys Ifans); slyly amorous Dave (Nick Frost); idiosyncratic New Zealander Angus (Rhys Darby); the rarely seen Bob (Ralph Brown); the aptly named Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke); lovelorn Simon (Chris ODowd); ladies magnet Mark (Tom Wisdom); shy Harold (Ike Hamilton); reporter News John (Will Adamsdale); and lesbian ships cook Felicity (Katherine Parkinson). One night in 1966, Quentins teenaged godson Carl (Tom Sturridge) comes aboard. While Carl harbors romantic aspirations that he hopes will be fulfilled during one of the biweekly visits by Radio Rocks prettiest fans, he also hopes to find out more about his long-absent father As the ship sails on and rocks out, what Carl and the freewheeling, free-loving Radio Rock gang dont know is that back in London, landlocked government minister Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) has embarked on a vehement crusade to silence their signal - permanently. To stay afloat and keep their devoted audience plugged in, the crew will have to band together and trust in the power of music like never before",946026,1925,492,138,0,0.198629

Together they wander the desert in search of a great reunion of dervishes that takes place just once every thirty years. With faith as their only guide, the two journey for days through the expansive, barren landscape. To keep Ishtar entertained, Bab'Aziz relays the ancient tale of a prince who relinquished his realm in order to remain next to a small pool in the desert, staring into its depths while contemplating his soul. As the tale of the prince unfolds, the two encounter other travelers with stories of their own--including Osman, who longs for the beautiful woman he met at the bottom of a well, and Zaid, who searches for the ravishing young woman who fled from him after being seduced by his songs. Filled with breathtaking images and wonderful music, Nacir Khemir has created a fairytale-like story of longing and belonging, filmed in the enchanting and ever-shifting sandscapes of Tunisia and Iran.

Plot: A multi-strand narrative set in early 1980's Los Angeles, centered on an array of characters who represent both the top of the heap (a Hollywood dream merchant, a dissolute rock star, an aging newscaster) and the bottom (a voyeuristic doorman, an amoral ex-con). Connecting the intertwining strands are a group of beautiful, blonde young men and women who sleep all day and party all night, doing drugs -- and one another --with abandon, never realizing that they are dancing on the edge of a volcano.

Inspired by the director's firsthand experience with Central American immigrants, Sin Nombre opens to find dejected teenager Sayra (Paulina Gaitan) biding her time in Honduras while dreaming of a brighter future. Upon reuniting with the father she hasn't seen in years, Sayra seizes the opportunity to finally make her dreams a reality. Her father has a new family in the United States, and he's preparing to travel with her uncle to Mexico, where they will then cross the border to freedom. Meanwhile, in Mexico, Tapachula teen Casper (aka Casper, played by Edgar Flores), has gotten caught up with the notorious Mara Salvatrucha street gang. He's just delivered a new recruit to the Maras in the form of desperate 12-year-old Smiley (Kristyan Ferrer), and though the youngster's initiation proves particularly rough, she adapts to gang life rather quickly. As involved as Casper is with the Mara, he does his best to keep his relationship with girlfriend Martha Marlene (Diana Garcia) a secret from the gang. Just as Martha encounters ruthless Mara leader Lil' Mago (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) and suffers a grim fate at the hands of the gang, Sayra and her relatives arrive at the Tapachula train yards and prepare to rush a U.S.-bound freight train with a horde of other immigrants. Rather than attempting to gain access to the cars, Sayra and the rest of the immigrants decide to ride atop the train. Little do they realize that their lives are now in danger, because Lil' Mago has recruited Casper and Smiley to rob the immigrants as they make their way to the United States. When dawn comes and Lil' Mago makes his move, Casper finally decides to stand up to the tyrannical gang leader. Now, as the train winds though the Mexican countryside, Sayra's only hope of surviving the journey and making her way to a new beginning is to align herself with Casper as he flees from the most feared gang in Tapachula. © Revolver Entertainment.",155803,0,1,91,0,-0.6808

Heres the original trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9b1dwDOPwY
Nearly a decade after impressing audiences at the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival with their engaging coming-of-age story Goat on Fire & Smiling Fish, filmmakers Derick and Steven Martini return to deliver this period drama following two families whose lives are profoundly affected by complex relationships, real estate woes, and Lyme disease. Set on Long Island in the late '70s, Lymelife opens to find a suburban community swept up in fear after local resident Charlie Bragg (Timothy Hutton) is diagnosed with Lyme disease. Charlie's tightly wound neighbor Brenda Bartlett (Jill Hennessy) is determined not to let her gentle 15-year-old son, Scott (Rory Culkin), suffer a similar fate, and has taken to duct-taping his cuffs to ensure that he remains Lyme disease-free. Meanwhile, as Charlie convalesces, his wife, Melissa (Cynthia Nixon), goes to work for Brenda's philandering husband, Mickey (Alec Baldwin), a respected real estate developer. All the while, Melissa remains clueless to the fact that she was hired more out of lust than as a friendly favor to a neighbor in need. For years, Scott has pined after Charlie and Brenda's daughter, Adrianna (Emma Roberts), and strangely enough, it seems that she's finally starting to return his affections. Tensions are running particularly high in the neighborhood lately, and when Scott's older brother, Jimmy (Kieran Culkin), arrives home on leave from the army, his confrontations with his tempestuous father, Mickey, threaten to trigger repercussions that will affect the lives of everyone involved.

Daylight Robbery Synopsis

Alex (Geoff Bell, The Business) masterminds an ambitious plan to steal millions of untraceable cash that is stacked in the underground vaults of The London Exchange Bank, waiting for its last journey, Incineration.

Lucky (Vas Blackwood, Lock Stock) Matty (Leo Gregory, Stoned) Terry (Johnny Harris, London to Brighton) Chubby (Paul Nicholls, The Trench) Norman (Justin Salinger, Hitler) and Jay (Robert Boulter, The Long Firm) make up his unlikely gang of robbers.

Instead of passing through to Departure Lounge, the gang head out to the car park, pile into a van and head for Central London where they spectacularly ram raid London Exchange Bank, blocking any exit for those caught up inside.

But with an unexpected turn of events, their plan is hampered from the start and they are left with a whole lot more than just a bank robbery to deal with.

They have twenty hostages inside and the Police have laid siege to The Bank. There are two and a half hours before their plane leaves, and seventy million pounds in hard cash to steal.

mDroz5jDo_o,Fanboys Movie Trailer HD 2009 - TrailerHits.com,"http://TrailerHits.com is the first show to review movie trailers. Is 'Fanboys' a Trailer Hit or a Trailer Miss?

Plot:
It's the Halloween party they've all been waiting for, to have fun with friends and hang out with fellow Star Wars fans and partners in crime. However, events take a turn when one of their bunch who long ago outgrew his old gang and took on adult responsibilities is suddenly in their midst again. Reconnecting is not easy. But soon, Eric, Windows, Hutch and Zoe realize that Linus will not live long enough to experience what's been on their minds for ages: The long-awaited theatrical release of Star Wars - Episode I, which is still several months away. Linus once again suggests to his friends what he's been scheming since fifth grade: Breaking into Skywalker Ranch, this time to steal a print of the movie. Crazy, right? But it might be the only way for Linus to see the movie before he dies. So as insane as it sounds, they take Hutch's van and embark on a mission to drive across half the country to the Ranch.

That's the basic premise of the movie Fanboys, by Kyle Newman (director) and Adam F. Goldberg (screenwriter), which was shot in New Mexico in 2006. It may at first sound a bit trivial and maybe even a little cheesy, but the things that have been said about it suggest that you shouldn't let yourself be fooled by the simplistic-sounding plot. There's a bit of comedy, a bit of road movie, a bit of drama; overall it sounds like a great blend of elements that will invite not only Star Wars and sci-fi fans to the theaters, but everyone else as well. -IMDB",105179,122,32,228,0,0.306459375

SHy-hNklpAk,How to Cook your Life Trailer,"A Zen priest from Fairfax, California. Wise, clever and often surprisingly wrathful: Edward Espe Brown. Author of the famous Tassajara cookbooks, philosopher, Zen teacher and master chef.
Doris Dörrie met with Edward Brown and he told her about his life. She participated in his lectures, watched the master in the kitchen and in his cooking classes. Under Edward Espe Browns guidance, cooking is more than just providing food. Cooking, or better, knowing how to cook, is a matter of caring for yourself and others. Without romanticizing Edward Espe Brown and his work, Doris Dörrie succeeds in capturing the magic moment where practical advice unlocks wisdom and deepness.
A Zen monk shows us the sensuality of baking bread, the philosophy of radishes and the serenity of carrots. It is not just a culinary delight but also makes us a bit wiser.

Timothy, prone to escaping his dismal high school reality through dazzling musical daydreams, gets to answer that question in a very real way. After his eccentric teacher casts him as Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream, he stumbles upon a recipe hidden within the script to create the play's magical, purple love-pansy. Armed with the pansy, Timothy's fading spirit soars as he puckishly imposes a new reality by turning much of his narrow-minded town gay, beginning with the rugby-jock of his dreams.

Celebrated director Philippe Lioret's award-winning new drama WELCOME is a compassionate and inspiring story about the hope of new beginnings and the power of love, centring on two couples contending with issues of separation and dislocation.

17-year-old Bilal has spent three months travelling across Europe, in an attempt to reunite with his girlfriend Mina, who has moved with her family to London. The long journey is almost over when he finally reaches the coast of France; the English channel is his last obstacle. But with all legal options exhausted, Bilal resolves that his only option is to make the crossing himself.

He seeks the help of middle-aged swimming instructor Simon (Vincent Lindon), who is privately reeling from impending divorce from his socially-conscious wife. In an effort to win her back, Simon impulsively - and somewhat uncharacteristically - risks everything by taking Bilal under his wing...

A huge critical & box office success in its native France, this subtle but profoundly moving masterwork was awarded both the Ecumenical Jury Prize and Europa Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival, named Best Film at the 2010 Lumiere Awards, and has received an astonishing ten César (French Oscar) nominations, including Best Film, Director and Actor. It's a cinema experience not to be missed.",329170,874,76,152,0,0.14652881355932204

Nick - He's a chef. Ambar - She's a Radio Jockey. They're young, they're cool, they're independent -and together they make the PERFECT pair! Or do they?

Surrounded by quirky friends, bosses and landlords but far away from home. Nick and Ambar take a huge leap of faith as they decide to move in together. And now they must tiptoe towards getting to know each other? They are attracted to each other - but they fight. They live together, but as friends, in different rooms. They're in a relationship... but then again they're not. They seem to want the same things, but it seems that they have very little in common.

Between all this chaos, they find out that Ambar is pregnant. Nick doesn't want the baby. How the two handle this dilemma is what will decide the direction this relationship will take and be the real test of their love.

So are they really made for each other? Are they actually compatible? Is this whole thing worth it? After all, if a relationship is what happens when you're busy not thinking about it - then what does it mean when everything has to be such a ""decision""?

SALAAM NAMASTE gives us a quirky take on life, love and relationship as it looks at a fairy tale with a bit of a squint. Full of colour, humour and zest it is an endearing look at what being in love really means!!!",0,7396,242,120,0,0.22172699999999998

Plot: ""Eight medical students on a ski trip to Norway discover that Hitler's horrors live on when they come face to face with a battalion of undead Nazi soldiers intent on devouring anyone unfortunate enough to wander into the remote mountains where they were once sent to die. It's Easter vacation, and what better way to spend the break than skiing down the isolated hills just outside of Øksfjord, Norway? After packing their cars with enough beer and ski equipment to ensure that a good time will be had by all, the students set out for their destination and prepare for a relaxing snowbound getaway. Shortly after arriving at their remote cabin, however, the students receive an unexpected visit from a rather suspicious hiker. According to their shady visitor, the Nazis occupied this territory during World War II. In the aftermath of their brutal raping and pillaging, the locals revolted, driving the few surviving Nazi soldiers -- including their iron-fisted leader, Colonol Herzog -- deep into the hills. Neither the soldiers nor their leader were ever seen again. Everyone in town assumed that they simply froze to death. But there's something stirring out there in the trees, and it won't be long until the unsuspecting students discover how the story really ends.""",69319,77,11,300,0,0.19511818181818183

Azazel Jacobs' MOMMA'S MAN chronicles the increasingly anxious dilemma of Mikey (Matt Boren), a young husband and father who stops off at his parents' loft during a business trip to New York and finds himself emotionally unable to leave. One of the most acclaimed films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, Jacobs' third feature is both a tribute to his parents (avant-garde filmmaker Ken Jacobs and painter Flo Jacobs, who play Mikey's mother and father) and an acutely perceptive, slyly humorous take on a universal experience: the fear of growing up.

History was made...by these guys? Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera) are cavemen who stumble out of the mountains into an epic journey of biblical proportions. One's a bumbling hunter, the other's a gentle gatherer; together, they become unlikely participants in history's most pivotal moments. Directed and co-written by comedy legend Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, Analyze This), YEAR ONE is rude, crude, wildly absurd, deliciously tasteless and laugh-out-loud funny!

Horten has been forced to retire after 40 years of traveling a very stable rail, and the platform does not feel like a safe place anymore. His orderly, solitary existence is about to give way to a future of unlikely adventures and puzzling dilemmas: will Horten ever travel by plane? Will he finally sell his prized boat? How does Horten end up in a pair of womens red high-heeled shoes? Will he survive a nighttime drive with a blindfolded man at the wheel? Proof positive that there is humor to be found in aging, and we dont have to be elderly Norwegians to identify, laugh and embrace life in all its idiosyncratic splendor. OHORTEN is Bent Hamers wonderfully skewed view of the human condition and gives us that somewhat absurdist vision with great warmth, a little melancholy and universal appeal.",31170,77,14,133,0,0.7022538461538462

Crazy camels, dust storms and days spent chasing wayward sheep; this is the life of a shepherd on the bleak and windswept Kazakh steppes  and it is all young Asa dreams about.

After completing his naval service, Asa travels back to the Hunger steppe where his sister and her shepherd husband live a nomadic life. Although eager to care for a flock of his own, Asa is told he must get married before he can become a fully-fledged shepherd.

His one and only hope for marriage on the deserted steppe is Tulpan, the beautiful daughter of another shepherd family. Asa is disappointed to learn that Tulpan doesnt like him because she thinks his ears are too big, but he doesnt give up! Instead, he continues to dream of a life that may not be possible...

Polished, funny and utterly charming, Kazakhstan director Sergey Dvortsevoy's first feature film tells of a family not only surviving but also relishing the harsh life of nomad shepherds on a barren landscape.

Film Description: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Marc Webb's wry, nonlinear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary, Summer (Deschanel), Tom discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love the Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Tom is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Tom believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his.

fPaLm-Q7so8,Blue Blood Trailer - DVD out Oct 1st!,"Released on DVD Soon!

Visit the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and you'll see dreaming spires, tranquil meadows and academics all ... all » tweed. Don't be fooled.

Tear up the postcard and prepare yourself for a vision scarcely imaginable. For behind the civilised facade lurks a dark secret. One night a year the age-old foes lock their doors for a bloody fist-fight.

In an ancient hall, packed to the rafters with 2000 enraged students, the bell rings for round one of the Oxford vs Cambridge Varsity Boxing Match.

Blue Blood follows five drastically different Oxford students and their blue-collar coach in the run-up to the highly-charged showdown with Cambridge.

Playfully contrasting the brutality of the sport with the intellectual reputation of the schools, Blue Blood bucks the trend of the steroid-shooting superhero with disarming expressions of doubt and insecurity. It is soon clear that the story is less about posh boys beating the hell out of each other, than painfully self-aware young men in search of redemption and greatness. Blue Blood will released on May 11th",3614,4,2,110,0,-0.2963

dqRiIOy7A64,The Giant of Marathon (1959) [Action] [Adventure] [Drama],"This classical peplum tells a fictitious story set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars during which Persian armies sweep the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Philippides joins as commander the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the chasing of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to side Philippides by marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before the learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the Persian King of kings Darius's vast army is marching on Greece, hoping its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. 

Theocrites reproaches Miltiades to hold back the sacred guard to defend the Pallas temple after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Philippides makes the journey and survives a fiendish attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by traitor Theocrites, is heading for Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Philippides ahead to hold out with the sacred guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they do a great job, proving superior athletes can do better than traditional naval ramming tactics.

Her plans are cut short when she is approached by a former courtesan and arch rival, the barb-throwing gossip Charlotte Peloux (Kathy Bates), who encourages Lea to teach her disaffected 19 year-old son — a bon vivant nicknamed Chéri (Rupert Friend) — a thing or two about women. The resulting escapades involve power struggles over sex, money, age and society  and unexpectedly, love itself — as a boy who refuses to grow up collides with a woman who realizes she cannot stay young forever.

mxJJqr9hpMI,THE GANG'S ALL HERE Trailer (Masters of Cinema),"The iconic director-choreographer Busby Berkeley's first full-length film in Technicolor is well established as being perhaps the most visually stunning spectacle of any Hollywood musical. But to focus on this risks overlooking its exuberant performances, gleeful humour, sensational music and glowing romance, amidst countless other pleasures.

A young soldier's fast-struck love affair with a New York City nightclub singer, despite his long-standing betrothal to a wealthy childhood friend, provides the catalyst for this dizzying parade of home-front melodrama, comic set-pieces and mind-boggling musical numbers (including 'The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat' and 'The Polka-Dot Polka').

Featuring some of the most popular musical stars of its day, including Alice Faye, the incomparable Carmen Miranda, and the legendary Benny Goodman, along with brilliantly funny supporting turns from Edward Everett Horton, Eugene Pallette, and Charlotte Greenwood, The Gang's All Here is an outlandishly surprising classic from one of the Hollywood dream factory's most influential innovators. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present a world premiere of a stunning new restoration on Blu-ray.  Available from 15 September 2014

TLpqToSH8iw,Cold Souls Trailer,"Director:Sophie Barthes
Genre:Comedy | Drama 
Paul Giamatti stars as himself, agonizing over his interpretation of ""Uncle Vanya."" Paralyzed by anxiety, he stumbles upon a solution via a New Yorker article about a high-tech company promising to alleviate suffering by extracting souls. Giamatti enlists their service -- only to discover that his soul is the shape and size of a chickpea. His intention is to reinstate it once he survives the performance but complications ensue when a mysterious, soul-trafficking ""mule"" borrows Giamatti's stored soul for an ambitious, but unfortunately talentless, Russian soap-opera actress.


In response to shiny, bigger, better American consumerism comes Cold Souls, a metaphysical comedy in which souls can be extracted and traded as commodities. Balancing on a tightrope between deadpan humor and pathos, and between reality and fantasy, the film presents Paul Giamatti as himself, agonizing over his interpretation of Uncle Vanya. Paralyzed with anxiety, he stumbles upon a solution via a New Yorker article about a high-tech company promising to alleviate suffering by deep-freezing souls. Giamatti enlists their services, intending to reinstate his soul once he survives the performance. But complications ensue when a mysterious, soul-trafficking mule borrows Giamatti's stored soul for an ambitious, but unfortunately talentless, soap-opera actress. Rendered soulless, he is left with no choice but to follow the trail back to St. Petersburg.

cJ1ypLMHnbY,The Deal (2008) - OFFICIAL Trailer,"The official trailer for The Deal, starring WIlliam H. Macy, Meg Ryan, LL Cool J, and Elliott Gould!

Distributed by Peace Arch Entertainment. 
Directed by Steven Schachter.

Meet Charlie Berns, a guy whose suicidal tendencies give him the chutzpah to con a major studio into a $100 million deal on a script he hasn't even read. At the very moment when his idealistic screenwriter nephew knocks on the door, toting a solemn art-house period script about Benjamin Disraeli, Charlie has literally had it with life. But the trade papers have announced that a recently converted black action star is actively seeking Jewish material, so the serendipity is too absurd to resist. 

Charlie masterminds a plan, making it impossible for the studio not to green-light this project, which, while Jewish, couldn't be further from an action flick. No matter. In Hollywood, perception is everything. Along the way, Charlie meets his match in Deidre Hearn, a sharp-witted development executive who sees right through his games but also recognizes that maybe his caution-to-the-wind philosophy has serious merit. 

The mischievous charm in this smart screwball satire about renegade producers bamboozling a soul-crushing industry hinges on the wonderfully crackly Tracy-Hepburn chemistry between William Macy and Meg Ryan. Steven Schachter's tongue-in-cheek romp revels in sending up Hollywood stereotypes—zealous star, histrionic director, slippery suits—but also Ryan's legacy as romantic comedy's ""it"" girl, and even the notion that it's possible to make a meaningful movie.",311960,163,18,123,0,0.4405294117647059

Swiftly apprehended and originally sentenced to 7 years in jail, Peterson has subsequently been behind bars for 34 years, 30 of which have been spent in solitary confinement. With an intelligent, provocative and stylized approach, BRONSON (based on a true story) follows the metamorphosis of Mickey Peterson into Britain's most dangerous prisoner, Charles Bronson.",3261050,14031,560,143,0,0.11957600000000002

Nwqwb737wfI,Trailer - The Curiosity of Chance Official (Updated),"Writer/Director Russell P. Marleau gives the John Hughes-styled high school comedy a queer twist in this touching coming-of-age tale. It's the 1980's, when new wave angst and gender-bending fashion were all the rage. The new kid at school Chance Marquis (Tad Hilgenbrinck of American Pie Presents: Band Camp), however is out. And his being a gay, somewhat awkward teenager makes him the target of the school bully. To deal with this dilemma, Chance turns to the opposite ends of the high school spectrum for help. On one end is the flamboyant drag queen and at the other, the varsity jock, Levi Sparks (Brett Chuckerman of Eating Out 2) on whom Chance has a bit of a crush. Chockfull of the comic conventions of the high school genre - the idiot faculty, the good-hearted but delusional parents, the fairy tale reversal of popularity - The Curiosity of Chance is a frothy bit of nostalgic filmmaking. But like with the best of John Hughes, knowing the genre doesn't mean its story won't also touch your heart.",46882,174,12,103,0,0.6981777777777778

The spring election of the Popular Front government gives rise to the craziest hopes and extremism of every sort.

nwKmG9gliw0,Murder Ahoy (1964) - Trailer,"Shiver me timbers - the dreadnought with good manners returns!

""Murder Ahoy"" was the last of the four Miss Marple films produced by MGM in the sixties (not counting Rutherford and Davis's in-character cameo appearances in ""The Alphabet Murders"").

To date, it is the only film based on an Agatha Christie character but featuring a non-Christie plot - I would disagree with that, having seen the recent television ""Marple"" adaptations of ""Nemesis"" and ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" - did the writers even read the novels in those examples?

""Murder Ahoy"" does, however, borrow plot elements from ""They Do It With Mirrors"" and includes murder by ""Mousetrap"", a nod to the title of Christie's long-running (and now world-record breaking) play.

Christie was not pleased that MGM had chosen to film their own original plot and fit in Miss Marple, feeling that if the company could be so carefree with their treatment of the character, why could they not concoct their own mystery plots for the films and have Rutherford play an original character e.g. Miss Sampson (a subconcious nod to Dorothy L. Sayer's character, Miss Climpson, perhaps?)

Most reviewers are dismissive of this entry (from memory, Halliwell's Film Guide refers to it as ""all chat and no interest"") but along with ""Murder Most Foul"", it is the series' high point for me. I imagine this is largely down to the cast, to my mind the best assembled for the Miss Marple films.

Please do NOT ask for the whole film to be uploaded - in any event, it won't be. Also, any comments giving spoilers will be deleted.",19960,63,2,95,0,0.0

http://www.twitter.com/faqtimetravel

Three men walk into a bar; two geeks and a cynic.

They are three ordinary blokes who all have dreams and hopes for an exciting and better future. They are stuck in boring jobs with no prospects. They are frustrated and life on the whole looks uneventful.
They are about to sit down and have an average night out in their local pub, a few beers, a bit of banter and joking, and putting the world to rights. There is no reason to suspect anything unusual is going to happen.  

The first geek, Ray, has a well-known obsession with time travel, so when he is approached by Cassie, a woman who claims to be from the future, he naturally suspects a prank.

The second geek, Toby, is obsessed with films, and upon hearing Rays story of the woman from the future, naturally assumes that Ray is pitching him a film plot. And Pete, the cynic, naturally doesnt believe any of it, until he accidentally stumbles through a time leak into the future of the bar. Which happens to be full of dead people, including himself.

This triggers the start of a series of accidental trips back and forth through time, during which our heroes frantically try to avoid multiple earlier versions of themselves, to avoid creating a time paradox, in an attempt to unravel the mystery of just who is trying to kill them and why.

When Ray and Cassie get together in the garden and the world spins back on its axis, everything is back to how it should be. Or is it? When Ray mentions the other woman he met in the bar, Millie, to Cassie all hell breaks loose... Serious questions are raised, such as; exactly what are the golden rules of time travel? What exactly is a paradox? And whats really so bad about ceasing to exist? Whose round is it? Is the sell-by date on a packet of crisps really that important? And most importantly of all, can Ray get it on with Cassie, the woman from the future?",555107,737,4,112,0,-0.04880000000000001

3SooBX1-kIQ,The Informant! | Film Trailer | Participant Media,"What was Mark Whitacre thinking? A rising star at agri-industry giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Whitacre suddenly turns whistleblower. Even as he exposes his company's multi-national price-fixing conspiracy to the FBI, Whitacre envisions himself being hailed as a hero of the common man and handed a promotion. But before all that can happen, the FBI needs evidence, so Whitacre eagerly agrees to wear a wire and carry a hidden tape recorder in his briefcase, imagining himself as a kind of de facto secret agent. Unfortunately for the FBI, their lead witness hasn't been quite so forthcoming about helping himself to the corporate coffers. Whitacre's ever-changing account frustrates the agents and threatens the case against ADM as it becomes almost impossible to decipher what is real and what is the product of Whitacre's rambling imagination. Based on the true story of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history.

ISLAND OF TERROR!

A weekend retreat on a private island should be a recipe for rest and relaxation – unless you’re appearing in a giallo by the master of the macabre, Mario Bava (Black Sunday, Blood and Black Lace)…

Wealthy industrialist George Stark (Teodora Corrà, Django the Bastard) has gathered a group of friends – played by a who’s who of Italian genre cinema including William Berger (Faccia a faccia), Ira von Fürstenberg (The Fifth Cord), Edwige Fenech (Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key) and Howard Ross (The New York Ripper) – to his island retreat. He hopes to entice them into investing in a new project, but soon the sunbathing and cocktails parties give way to murder, as the corpses begin to pile up one by one.

Paying homage to Agatha Christie’s Ten Little Indians, Five Dolls for an August Moon turns the style up to ten. Surrounded by beautiful women, stunning locations and flamboyant fashions – and abetted by Piero Umiliani’s equally exotic score – Bava creates one of his most eye-catching movies, a visual tour de force.

Robin Williams stars as Lance Clayton, a man who has learned to settle. He dreamed of being a rich and famous writer, but has only managed to make it as a high school poetry teacher. His only son Kyle (Daryl Sabara) is an insufferable jackass who won't give his father the time of day. He is dating Claire (Alexie Gilmore), the school's adorable art teacher, but she doesn't want to get serious -- or even acknowledge publicly that they are dating. Then, in the wake of a freak accident, Lance suffers the worst tragedy and greatest opportunity of his life. He is suddenly faced with the possibility of all the fame, fortune and popularity he ever dreamed of, if he can only live with the knowledge of how he got there. Written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, WORLD'S GREATEST DAD stars Robin Williams, Alexie Gilmore, Daryl Sabara, Geoff Pierson, Henry Simmons and Mitzi McCall.

Ed764yEk9Co,Original Theatrical Trailer | The Five Man Army | Warner Archive,"The Five Man Army (1969) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #TheFiveManArmy

Where this army leads, action fans -- especially Spaghetti Western fans -- will want to follow. Set during the Mexican Revolution, The Five Man Army is a niftily executed tale of mercenaries who, on behalf of rebel forces, take on a mission to rob a trainload of gold. Make that a suicide mission, because this train is heavily armored; armed with troops, cannon and machine guns, and traveling a route guarded by more soldiers. Peter Graves, then known for his role as mastermind Jim Phelps in TV's Mission: Impossible, faces another odds-defying task as the Dutchman, leader of a handpicked commando squad consisting of a strongman, an explosives expert, a circus acrobat and a Samurai swordsman. Famed composer Ennio Morricone's throbbing score amplifies the action of this ready-to-be-rediscovered film that, writes The New York Times's Vincent Canby, is ""for anybody who enjoys lean, taut suspense with no fiddling around."" All aboard!

Anna Wintour, the legendary editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine for twenty years, is the most powerful and polarizing figure in fashion. Hidden behind her trademark bob and sunglasses, she has never allowed anyone to scrutinize the inner workings of her magazine. Until now. With unprecedented access, filmmaker R.J. Cutlers new film THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE does for fashion what he did for politics in The War Room, taking the viewer inside a world they only think they know. Every August a record-breaking number of people cant wait to get their hands on the September issue of Vogue. The 2007 issue was and remains the biggest ever, weighing over four pounds, selling thirteen million copies, and impacting the $300-billion global fashion industry more than any other single publication. An intimate, funny and surprising look at Anna Wintour and her team of larger-than-life editors as they create this must-have Bible of fashion, Cutler explores the untouchable glamour of Wintours Vogue to reveal the extraordinarily passionate people at its heart. He takes us behind the scenes at Fashion Week, to Europe, on shoots and reshoots, and into closed-door staff meetings, bearing witness to an arduous, entertaining, and sometimes emotionally demanding process. At the eye of this annual fashion hurricane is the two-decade relationship between Wintour and Grace Coddington, incomparable Creative Director and fashion genius. They are perfectly matched for the age-old conflict between creator and curator. Through them, we see close-up the delicate creative chemistry it takes to remain at the top of the ever-changing fashion field.",1021015,1710,242,149,0,0.25272500000000003

Ob4wXhsbiFQ,Abbott and Costello - The Foreign Legion (1950),"Plot:
Bud Jones (Bud Abbott) and Lou Hotchkiss (Lou Costello) are wrestling promoters. Their star, Abdullah (Wee Willie Davis), no longer wishes to follow the script for their crooked matches, especially since he is supposed to lose his next match. Abdullah leaves America to return to his homeland, Algeria. The promoters' financiers, a syndicate that has lent them $5,000 to bring Abdullah to the States, are now requiring them to return the money or face the consequences. The two men follow Abdullah to Algeria in hopes of bringing him back.

Meanwhile, Abdullah's cousin, Sheik Hamud El Khalid (Douglass Dumbrille) and a crooked Foreign Legionnaire, Sergeant Axmann (Water Slezak), have been raiding a railroad construction site in order to extort ""protection"" money from the railroad company. When Bud and Lou arrive, they are mistaken for company spies, and the Sheik and Axmann attempt to murder them. As each attempt fails, the assassins' hatred for Bud and Lou intensifies, especially when Lou outbids the Sheik for six slave girls, one of whom, Nicole (Patricia Medina), is actually a French spy assigned to gain entry into the Sheik's camp. The boys are then chased, only to wind up hiding at the Foreign Legion headquarters, where Axmann convinces them to join.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Legion Commandant (Fred Nurney) suspects that there is a traitor among the Legionnaires, as the Sheik anticipates every one of the Legion's moves (secretly through Axmann). The Commandant then grants Bud and Lou a pass into town where they meet up with Nicole. She informs them that they must search Axmann's room for proof that he is a traitor, but he catches them in the act. However, they are spared, only to end up at a Legionnaire desert camp. Just before the camp is ambushed by the Sheik's men, Bud and Lou wander off in search of a camel, and escape death. They are eventually captured, along with Nicole, who is put in Sheik Hamud's harem. The Shiek orders that one of his wrestlers execute them. The wrestler turns out to be Abdullah, who helps them escape. They head to Fort Apar, where they lure the Sheik's men, and blow it up. They are given awards by the Commandant and honourably discharged from the Legion. Lou thanks Nicole for helping them and gives his award to her before they leave, only for Bud to find out that Lou is taking the six slave girls with them back to the States.

Synopsis:
Alain Resnais pays tribute to three influential French filmmakers Georges Melies, Marcel L Herbier and Eric Rohmer with this lighthearted film about happiness and the power of the imagination. Life Is a Bed of Roses is divided into three parallel narratives. The first section is set around the first decade of the twentieth century in the Ardennes, where Count Forbeck (Ruggero Raimondi) unveils his architect’s designs for a utopian city. In a modern day mirroring of this story, a group of professors now inhabiting Forbeck’s castle seek a new form of education through the use of the imagination, under the guidance of a guru named Guarini (Vittorio Gassman Big Deal on Madonna Street). The third segment depicts a Wagnerian fantasy landscape of kings and dragons, which arises from the imagination of the children of some of the professors at the school. With ingenuity and great craftsmanship, Resnais weaves together these three threads to make Life Is a Bed of Roses a compelling and entertaining mixture of drama, satire, comedy, fantasy and music.

Unflinching in its presentation of the truth and featuring a mesmerizing performance by newcomer Jonas Ball, THE KILLING OF JOHN LENNON is a gritty examination of Mark Chapman and his descent into madness and eventual exorcism.

The film was meticulously researched and filmed on actual locations where the events occurred. Chapman's dialogue is taken from interviews, depositions and court transcripts, grounding the film firmly in the realms of veracity. He was nobody, until he killed the biggest somebody on earth.

Daring, original and utterly genre-busting, Deadgirl is a terrifying journey to the dark heart of the American high school generation. Fantastical, frenzied and darkly hilarious, this is a horror movie, a high school comedy and a coming-of-age movie all turned on their sick and twisted heads.

When teenage misfits Rickie and JT cut school one day, they find themselves in the derelict remains of an abandoned hospital. The gruesome, unnerving discovery they make in the bowels of the facility will test the very limits of their sanity: a woman, naked, chained and covered in plastic. Shes abandoned, shes beautiful, shes dead...or is she?  

What follows is a warped odyssey that forces this pair of outcasts, their high-school tormentors and adolescent crushes to all decide just how far they're willing to stretch their understanding of what is right and what is very, very wrong.

From the producer of the seminal Hellraiser and the legendary Heathers, Marcel Sarmiento & Gadi Harel's Deadgirl is a new genre classic and a no-holds-barred look at the horror of growing up. Starring Shiloh Fernandez (The United States Of Tara), Noah Segan (Brick), Michael Bowen (Kill Bill), and Candice Accola (Juno).",909141,658,364,98,0,-0.11382099999999999

Buy one, I guarantee satisfaction.

This is a trailer for Lost Angeles that was made in 1989.  It was released on vhs with Orion and I believe is now owned by MGM.  This is my attempt to get the word out about this movie and possibly get a dvd release one day.  Here is a summary from movies.com: ""Tim Doolan (Adam Horovitz) hates his parents. His father (Graham Beckel) is an absentee ex-cop, and his mother (Celia Weston) is a simpering upper middle class socialite who has recently remarried and can't understand her alienated and destructive son. A rich Los Angeles teen lost in a world of gang violence, drugs, and despair, Tim, along with his half brother, Andy (Don Bloomfield), parties all night at local clubs and belongs to a wealthy white gang that attempts to be as tough and streetwise as neighboring Latino gangs. His sole comfort comes from Cheryl (Amy Locane), a troubled, beautiful girl he admires from afar. One night, after a nasty gang fight, Tim goes to Cheryl's house and finds her ready and willing to party. However, the night ends abruptly when Cheryl drives her mother's car into the family pool. Tim and Cheryl wake up in the morning to the Los Angeles police and their unforgiving parents. Whisked away to juvenile detention, Tim is then placed in a high-security sanitarium where rich kids are left to figure out their problems in group therapy, abandoned by their frustrated and busy parents. Tim reacts to the sanitarium with rage and aggression until he meets Dr. Loftis (Donald Sutherland), a stern but liberal therapist who is willing to help and listen. With the support of Loftis, Tim finally begins to realize his own sense of self-worth. Director Hugh Hudson's honest portrait of troubled teens is simultaneously dark and uplifting, with gritty and intense performances from its young cast. Veteran actor Sutherland is captivating in his complex and challenging role.""",91519,333,89,147,0,0.21937887323943664

Jifs9sGsVUY,Original Theatrical Trailer | See You In The Morning | Warner Archive,"See You In The Morning (1989) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #SeeYouInTheMorning

After his first marriage breaks up, New York psychiatrist Larry Livingston (Jeff Bridges) is about to try something even scarier: marriage #2. Alan J. Pakula wrote as well as directed this engaging slice of modern romance, using his own remarriage as an inspiration. Larry's second marriage carries lots of baggage from the past. He's still vulnerable to his ex (Farrah Fawcett), his new wife (Alice Krige) is temporarily overseas and all hell breaks loose at home. Yearning for attention, his stepdaughter (Drew Barrymore) has been jailed for shoplifting and his stepson (Lukas Haas), grieving for his deceased dad, has disappeared. From the tangles and confusions divorce and remarriage can cause -- and from a wonderful ensemble of actors, Pakula creates a moving celebration of love -- and family -- the second time around.

Directed By Alan J. Pakula
Starring Jeff Bridges, Alice Krige, Farrah Fawcett

2EPMDDZa6hQ,Ceddo (1977) (Ousmane Sembène) We do not want to Convert to Islam !,"The classic and controversial story of the ""outsiders"" in a West African village under the pressures of religious conversions and slavery in the 17th century.
OUSMANE SEMBÈNE was born in 1923 in the rainy Casamance region on the coast of Senegal in West Africa. The first film director from an African country to achieve international recognition, Sembène remains the major figure in the rise of an independent post-colonial cinema.

Sembène's roots were not in the educated élite. After working as a mechanic and bricklayer, he joined the Free French forces in 1942, serving in Africa and France. In 1946, he returned to Dakar, where he participated in the great railway strike of 1947. The next year he went to France, where he worked in a Citröen factory in Paris, and then, for ten years, on the dock in Marseilles. During this time Sembène became very active in trade union struggles and began an extraordinarily successful writing career. His first novel, ""Le Docker Noir"", was published in 1956. Since then, he has produced a number of influential literary works.

Long an avid filmgoer, Sembène became aware that to reach a mass audience of workers and Africans outside urban centers, cinema was a more effective vehicle than the written word. In 1961, he traveled to Moscow to study film. Upon his return to Senegal, Sembène made two short films, then wrote and directed his first feature, LA NOIRE DE... (BLACK GIRL, 1966). Shot in a simple, quasi-documentary style, BLACK GIRL tells the tragic story of a young Senegalese woman working as a maid for an affluent French family on the Riviera, focusing on her sense of isolation and growing despair. Her country may have been ""decolonized,"" but she is still a non-person in the colonizers' world. Sembène's next film, MANDABI (THE MONEY ORDER, 1968), marked a sharp departure. Based on his novel of the same name and shot in color in two language versions--French and Wolof, the main dialect of Senegal--THE MONEY ORDER is a trenchant and often delightfully witty satire of the new bourgeoisie, torn between outmoded patriarchal traditions and an uncaring, rapacious and inefficient bureaucracy. EMITAI (1971) records the struggle of the Diola people of the Casamance region against the French authorities during WWII. Shot in Diola dialect and French from an original script, EMITAI offers a respectful but unromanticized depiction of an ancient tribal culture, while highlighting the role of women in the struggle against colonialist oppression. In XALA (1975), Sembène again takes on the native bourgeoisie, this time in the person of a rich, partially Westernized Muslim businessman afflicted by ""xala"" (impotence) on the night of his wedding to a much younger third wife. CEDDO (1977), considered by some to be Sembène's masterpiece, departs from the director's customary realist approach, in documenting the struggle over the last centuries of an unspecified African society against the incursions of Islam and European colonialism. Featuring a strong female character, Ceddo is a powerful evocation of the African experience.

Senegal banned the film over its title's spelling (""Cedo"" was the romanized form favored by President Léopold Sédar Senghor). Further censorship forced Sembène to cut several scenes, but the director handed out pamphlets explaining the missing moments for Senegalese moviegoers. In some other Muslim-majority countries, the film was subjected to a complete ban, as some took offense to an unsanitized portrayal of the spread of their faith in times long past. Sembène did not intend to make an anti-Muslim statement; he refused a request by the Shah of Iran to use the film as propaganda against Muslims. In his films Sembène had always taken aim at the hypocrisies and cruelties of both colonial Europeans and Africans themselves, criticizing acts of domination regardless of the color, race or religion of the guilty party.

His final award-winning work MOOLADÉ focused on conflicts over female genital cutting, a village tradition the director could not tolerate. Sembène said: ""I believe today that Africans must get beyond the question of colour, they must recognise the problems which confront the whole world, as human beings like other human beings. If others undervalue us, that has no further significance for us. Africa must get beyond deriving everything from the European view. Africa must consider itself, recognise its problems and attempt to resolve them... Often in Africa it's only the men who speak, but one forgets the role, interest of women. I think the princess is the incarnation of modern Africa. There can be no development in Africa if women are left out of the account.""

Sembène died in Dakar at the age of 84, on June 9, 2007. He had been ill since December 2006, and died at his home in Dakar, Senegal where he was buried in a shroud adorned with Quranic verses.

Subscribe for more great documentaries!

Nearly 28 million people visited the Fair. Dubbed the “White City,” it inspired future innovators like Henry Ford and Frank Lloyd Wright, unveiled the Ferris Wheel and Cracker Jack®, and, in many ways, marked the beginning of the 20th century.  Many of the era’s greatest achievements in science, technology and culture were unveiled there. The grounds were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for his design of New York City’s Central Park, and constructed under the supervision of Daniel Burnham.

The Fair was an engineering marvel. On opening day, President Grover Cleveland depressed a golden telegraph key which sent the first courses of electricity throughout the Fair powering fountains, machines, electric railways and thousands of lights. It was the first use of electricity on such a massive scale.

In addition, fairgoers enjoyed the Midway Plaisance where a one-mile boulevard of fun offered camel riding and guilty pleasures such as belly dancing, street fighting and beer drinking. Against the backdrop of 1893’s troubles with workers’ rights, prejudice, discrimination and corruption, the World’s Columbian Exposition cast a brief ray of hope for the future of humanity.

Filmed in spectacular High-Definition, EXPO – Magic of the White City immerses viewers in one of the world’s biggest extravaganzas and one of the most unforgettable events in American history. There will never be another event like it… or will there?",477608,4175,1533,60,0,0.182836

Hundreds of passengers aboard an oncoming steam train are completely unaware of the danger that looms as they head toward an open drawbridge. As a desperate young woman witnesses an act of mercy beyond imagination, her life is changed forever—as are the lives of all who see this film. Both heart wrenching and glorious, MOST vividly portrays the greatest offering of love, sacrifice, hope, and forgiveness known to man.

bN0SlBE8yGQ,Broken Embraces | Official Trailer (2009),"A man writes, lives and loves in darkness. Fourteen years before, he was in a brutal car crash on the island of Lanzarote. In the accident, he not only lost his sight, he also lost Lena, the love of his life.
 
This man uses two names: Harry Caine, a playful pseudonym with which he signs his literary works, stories and scripts, and Mateo Blanco, his real name, with which he lives and signs the film he directs. After the accident, Mateo Blanco reduces himself to his pseudonym, Harry Caine. If he cant direct films he can only survive with the idea that Mateo Blanco died on Lanzarote with his beloved Lena.
 
In the present day, Harry Caine lives thanks to the scripts he writes and to the help he gets from his faithful former production manager, Judit García, and from Diego, her son, his secretary, typist and guide.
 
Since he decided to live and tell stories, Harry is an active, attractive blind man who has developed all his other senses in order to enjoy life, on a basis of irony and self-induced amnesia. He has erased from his biography any trace of his first identity, Mateo Blanco.
One night Diego has an accident and Harry takes care of him (his mother, Judit, is out of Madrid and they decide not to tell her anything so as not to alarm her). During the first nights of his convalescence, Diego asks him about the time when he answered to the name of Mateo Blanco, after a moment of astonishment Harry cant refuse and he tells Diego what happened fourteen years before with the idea of entertaining him, just as a father tells his little child a story so that hell fall asleep.
 
The story of Mateo, Lena, Judit and Ernesto Martel is a story of amour fou, dominated by fatality, jealously, the abuse of power, treachery and a guilt complex. A moving and terrible story, the most expressive image of which is the photo of two lovers embracing, torn into a thousand pieces.",402321,662,35,110,0,0.1138448275862069

9_iPKYe8gHI,Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans [Trailer 1] [HD] 2009,"Nicolas Cage plays a rogue detective who is as devoted to his job as he is at scoring drugs — while playing fast and loose with the law. He wields his badge as often as he wields his gun in order to get his way. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina he becomes a high-functioning addict who is a deeply intuitive, fearless detective reigning over the beautiful ruins of New Orleans with authority and abandon. Complicating his tumultuous life is the prostitute he loves. Together they descend into their own world marked by desire, compulsion, and conscience. The result is a singular masterpiece of filmmaking: equally sad and manically humorous.

BNi-ebCWXos,"The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) Official Trailer - Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson","In the second installment of Stephenie Meyers phenomenally successful TWILIGHT series, the romance between mortal and vampire soars to a new level as BELLA SWAN (Kristen Stewart) delves deeper into the mysteries of the supernatural world she yearns to become part of—only to find herself in greater peril than ever before.

Following Bellas ill-fated 18th birthday party, EDWARD CULLEN (Robert Pattinson) and his family abandon the town of Forks, Washington, in an effort to protect her from the dangers inherent in their world. As the heartbroken Bella sleepwalks through her senior year of high school, numb and alone, she discovers Edwards image comes to her whenever she puts herself in jeopardy. Her desire to be with him at any cost leads her to take greater and greater risks.

With the help of her childhood friend JACOB BLACK (Taylor Lautner), Bella refurbishes an old motorbike to carry her on her adventures. Bellas frozen heart is gradually thawed by her budding relationship with Jacob, a member of the mysterious Quileute tribe, who has a supernatural secret of his own.

When a chance encounter brings Bella face to face with a former nemesis, only the intervention of a pack of supernaturally large wolves saves her from a grisly fate, and the encounter makes it frighteningly clear that Bella is still in grave danger. In a race against the clock, Bella learns the secret of the Quileutes and Edwards true motivation for leaving her. She also faces the prospect of a potentially deadly reunion with her beloved that is a far cry from the one shed hoped for. With more of the passion, action and suspense that made TWILIGHT a worldwide phenomenon, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: NEW MOON is a spellbinding follow-up to the box office hit.

Director: James McTeigue
Writer: Matthew Sand, J. Michael Straczynski
Studio: Warner Brothers

========================================

Wow, I'm really excited about this one. I can't believe that is Bi Rain! He's sure come a long way from singing; and from acting in small romance TV shows. And his English? Wow, it sure has improved by the sounds of it. In 'Speed Racer' he had very little lines and was sort of hard to understand with his heavy accent. But in this trailer, his English is almost perfect.

In comparison, I'm surprised singers/actors like Justin Timberlake hasn't attempted to take on roles like this here in North America. Wow, seriously, I now have a new-found respect for Rain.

========================================

Plot: 
Ninja Assassin follows Raizo (Rain), one of the deadliest assassins in the world. Taken from the streets as a child, he was transformed into a trained killer by the Ozunu Clan, a secret society whose very existence is considered a myth. But haunted by the merciless execution of his friend by the Clan, Raizo breaks free from them and vanishes. Now he waits, preparing to exact his revenge.

In Berlin, Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) has stumbled upon a money trail linking several political murders to an underground network of untraceable assassins from the Far East. Defying the orders of her superior, Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles), Mika digs into top secret agency files to learn the truth behind the murders. Her investigation makes her a target, and the Ozunu Clan sends a team of killers, led by the lethal Takeshi (Rick Yune), to silence her forever. Raizo saves Mika from her attackers, but he knows that the Clan will not rest until they are both eliminated. Now, entangled in a deadly game of cat and mouse through the streets of Europe, Raizo and Mika must trust one another if they hope to survive and finally bring down the elusive Ozunu Clan.

Taken away from him and completely recut by the studio, it nevertheless ended up a critical and financial success. When the New York Times published a rave review, Feldman wrote a long letter to the critic telling him he was wrong. Apologies for the low picture quality of this transfer.

Using hidden cameras and never-before-seen footage, EARTHLINGS chronicles the day-to-day practices of the largest industries in the world, all of which rely entirely on animals for profit. 

MAKE THE CONNECTION http://www.earthlings.com/
EARTHLINGS is powerful, informative, controversial and thought-provoking.  By far the most comprehensive documentary ever produced on the correlation between nature, animals and questionable human economic interests.

Michael J. Fox is electrifying in a powerful tale of excess and redemption from bestselling author Jay McInerney and Oscar® winning producer Sydney Pollack (Out of Africa). Jamie Conway (Fox, Back To The Future) is an aspiring writer who leaves his home town in Kansas for the dynamic cityscape of Manhattan in an attempt to fuel his career and inform his writing experience. But the seductive side of life gets under his skin. The party culture enlivens his nights with hedonistic joy as he surfs a wave of excess that deadens his pain and wires his senses. In his charge to live life to the absolute limit, Jamie alienates his friends and family and risks losing everything.
Capturing the spirit of an era with a thumping soundtrack the film features a solid support from Kiefer Sutherland (24), Phoebe Cates (Drop Dead Fred) and Dianne Wiest (Parenthood).",101531,363,67,86,0,0.3522870967741935

Ex-Marine Ellie and shy bookworm Janis are fledgling female Feds who'd make Eliot Ness proud. More importantly, they'll make you laugh. Starring as these plucky FBI recruits are gangbuster comediennes Rebecca de Mornay (Risky Business, Wedding Crashers) and Mary Gross (Saturday Night Live, A Mighty Wind). ""Brawny"" Ellie and ""brainy"" Janis go together like ham and eggs, and their lives will be hilariously scrambled during their hilarious, hectic training. Janis must learn physicality and intimidation techniques, while Ellie needs a guiding hand to help get through the intricacies of constitutional law. So in true buddy fashion, they'll help each other prepare for the academy's final exam: a ""simulated crime exercise"" that chauvinistic lunkheads think will separate the men from the girls.

The Milagro Beanfield War Trailer - Directed by Robert Redford and starring RubÉn Blades, Richard Bradford, James Gammon, John Heard, Carlos Riquelme. In Milagro, a small town in the American Southwest, Ladd Devine plans to build a major new resort development. While activist Ruby Archuleta and lawyer/newspaper editor Charlie Bloom realize that this will result in the eventual displacement of the local Hispanic farmers, they cannot arouse much opposition because of the short term opportunities offered by construction jobs.

a123Dpj6Tq8,"Richard Dreyfuss in ""Moon Over Parador"" 1988 Movie Trailer","Moon over Parador is a (1988) romantic comedy film, starring Richard Dreyfuss, Raul Julia and Sonia Braga. It is a remake of the 1939 film The Magnificent Fraud, based on the unpublished short story entitled ""Caviare for His Excellency"" by Charles G. Booth.

The film follows the exploits of Jack Noah (Dreyfuss), who is filming in the small, fictional South American country of Parador when the Paradorian president-for-life suddenly dies of a heart attack. Not wanting to lose his position in power, the president's right-hand man, Roberto Strausmann (Raul Julia) forces Jack to take the 'role of a lifetime' - that of the dead president, as the two men look so much alike. Jack accepts, eventually winning over the people and even the dead president's mistress, Madonna (Sonia Braga). However, when paradise proves to be too boring, Jack needs to find a way to get out while keeping Roberto out of the loop.

He makes the acquaintance of grizzled prospector Spur, and Spur's more respectable brother Harrison (both played by Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas -- Spartacus). When Jim falls for Harrison's daughter, however, the old man doesn't approve. But Jim is in love and won't be deterred. He will prove his worth, no matter what the challenge!

2Kx5Ex3848k,Original Theatrical Trailer | Penn & Teller Get Killed | Warner Archive,"Penn & Teller Get Killed (1989) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #PennAndTellerGetKilled

The ""bad boys of magic"" go over the edge in this mind-blowing, role-switching comedy murder mystery set in the dizzying world of Altlantic City casinos. In a TV interview, Penn mentions his idea of a fun practical joke: ""I wish someone were trying to kill me. It would give focus to my life, excitement. I'd be like James Bond."" Twenty-million people hear him. One decides to deliver a punchline he'll never forget. Made by people who thought Psycho was a comedy, Penn & Teller Get Killed (they also wrote the piece) features Caitlin Clarke as the femme fatale and David Patrick Kelly as the Edgar Allan Poe-esque nutcase with a new mission. Arthur Penn, known for hip masterpieces like Bonnie and Clyde, Alice's Restaurant and Little Big Man, directs with roller-coaster pacing and subversive intelligence.

Directed By Arthur Penn
Starring Penn Jillette, Teller, Caitlin Clarke

She decides to hitchhike home, but on a whim, she ends up in Venice instead.

Her plans to return the next day are thwarted when she misses her train and does not have enough money to buy another ticket. Soon she is gainfully employed at a flower shop run by an irascible old anarchist. Though her teenaged sons do not seem all that bothered by their mom's absence, Rosalba's husband grows increasing agitated at the interruption in his routine, so he hires a bumbling detective to track her down.

Featuring wall-to-wall verbal and physical wit, Skin Deep tops itself with a scene that, even today, remains glowingly funny and original. “I can’t describe it to you. I can’t show it to you,” Joel Siegel of ABC-TV’s Good Morning America said, “but this film has one of the biggest laughs at the movies.”",143687,516,70,144,0,0.3891

The Hotel New Hampshire Trailer - Directed by Tony Richardson and starring Rob Lowe, Paul McCrane, Beau Bridges, Seth Green, Wally Aspell. John Irving's picaresque black comedy about an eccentric and unusually peripatetic family in a film starring Rob Lowe as John Berry, the family's oldest son. John's father, Win (Beau Bridges), is obsessed with hotels, so he buys a run-down seminary in New England, transforming it into the Hotel New Hampshire. The extended family includes the profanity-spouting Franny (Jodie Foster); Lily (Jennifer Dundas); a dwarf, Frank (Paul McCrane), who is gay; John, who is strongly attracted to his sister; Egg (Seth Green), the youngest boy; and Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley), Win's father. After a number of tragic incidents, including the gang rape of Franny, are seen through the special lenses of black comedy, the family is invited to take over another hotel in Vienna, courtesy of their friend Freud (Wallace Shawn). Richardson elicits fine performances from his talented cast in this wild ride through the mind of John Irving.

Complete title:
The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat ... Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade

Cast:
         Ian Richardson as Jean-Paul Marat
         Patrick Magee as Marquis de Sade
         Glenda Jackson as Charlotte Corday
         Susan Williamson as Marat's mistress
         Clifford Rose as Asylum director

production:
         Royal Shakespeare Company

Directed by:
        Peter Brook

Based on the play by:
         Peter Weiss

The Marquis de Sade is locked in the Charenton mental hospital and decides to put on a play. His overseers agree as long as he follows certain conditions. He writes and directs the other mental patients in a play based on the life of the Jean-Paul Marat. As the play progresses, the inmates become more and more possessed by the violence of the play and become extremely difficult to control. Finally, all chaos breaks loose. 


Awards: 
         Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists 1969 
         Won Silver Ribbon Best Director -- Foreign Film Peter Brook 
         Locarno International Film Festival 1967
         Won Special Mention Peter Brook 


Whether it's based on reality or not, Marat/Sade is an ambitious idea. The Marquis de Sade (Patrick Magee), often wrote and produced plays during his incarceration. Whether he made one about Jean-Paul Marat is debatable and this is certainly not based on anything Sade wrote. Marat/Sade is actually a filmed version of a play written in the early 1960s (and fully titled The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of The Marquis de Sade) by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Ian Richardson plays the bathtub-bound Marat, and Glenda Jackson plays his assassin. The only problem, of course, is that in the world of the film, Richardson is a lunatic paranoid and Jackson is a narcoleptic depressive. This makes for some strange interpretations of history, mental illness, heroism, and politics — and where we draw the lines among all these things. In the end, Marat/Sade comes off as more of a joke than a think-piece, unfortunately. We laugh at the participants instead of pitying them. We don't think about history and its interpretation: We think instead about what kind of royal person would willingly subject themselves to a presentation of this play. The chaos that erupts is completely expected. Better idea: Have a group of royals present a play inside a mental institution, and see how the inmates respond...",1826547,4049,184,60,0,0.214978

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Stifler (Seann William Scott) reunite for a summer of fun.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The horny teen heroes of American Pie (1999) return for further raunchy antics in this comedy sequel written by the first film's creator, Adam Herz. Returning home following their freshman year of college, old friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Stifler (Seann William Scott) rent a summer house on Lake Michigan where they hope to score romantically. However, complications ensue due to Jim's relative lack of experience, requiring an interlude with a fellow student and a visit to his old friend Michelle (Alyson Hanigan), who's now a band camp counselor, all in preparation for the return of Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). In the meantime, Oz is separated from Heather (Mena Suvari) by a trip abroad, Finch has another encounter with Stifler's mom (Jennifer Coolidge), and Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) is as clueless as ever about his son's love life. Director J.B. Rogers served as first assistant director on the first film and made his directorial debut with Say It Isn't So (2001).

M3lLNzTSRPo,Corelli's Mandolin Italian Trailer,"Tratto da un libro e una storia vera.
Film dedicato ai caduti Italiani e Greci in Cefalonia durante la guerra.
L'isola di Cefalonia subisce l'invasione dell'esercito italiano tra cui c'è il Capitano Antonio Corelli che s'innamora della bellissima Pelagia, figlia del medico del villaggio. La guerra si avvicina e Antonio e Pelagia devono scegliere tra la fedeltà ai loro rispettivi paesi ed il loro amore, per il quale dovranno affrontare enormi difficoltà e inevitabili sacrifici prima di giurarsi eterna devozione.
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a 2001 film directed by John Madden and based on the novel of the same name by Louis de Bernières. It stars Nicolas Cage and Penélope Cruz. The film was panned by critics on its release and disappointed fans by deviating somewhat from the plot of the novel, with many of the book's tragic episodes softened.
The main characters are Antonio Corelli, an Italian captain, and Pelagia, the daughter of the local physician, Dr. Iannis. An important event in the novel is the massacre of Italian troops by the Germans in September 1943.The idyllic beauty of Greece's Mediterranean islands has been invaded by Italy, bringing legions of soldiers to the once tranquil island of Cephallonia. Captain Antonio Corelli, an officer with an irrepressibly jovial personality and passion for the mandolin, initially alienates a number of the villagers, including Pelagia. The daughter of the village doctor, Pelagia is an educated and strong-willed woman, and while at first offended by the Italian soldier's behaviour, she slowly warms to his certain charms as they are forced to share her father's home.
When Pelagia's fiance, a local fisherman, heads off to war, the friendship between Antonio and Pelagia grows even stronger. Her beauty and intelligence have captured his heart and his fondness for the village's vibrant community causes him to question his reasons for fighting. Antonio becomes a part of the lives of the villagers, but the moment is fleeting. As the war grows ever closer, Antonio and Pelagia are forced to choose between their allegiance to their countries and the love they feel for one another-a love which must overcome tremendous odds, and endure the inevitable sacrifice which accompanies eternal devotion.

Ew0ALiiBmlg,Happy Accidents - Movie Trailer,"Ruby Weaver has man trouble: she tries to fix them, so she's stuck herself with a string of losers. Her current lover, Sam Deed, seems different: he's sweet, tender, just in from Dubuque. But, as Ruby tells her therapist about Sam, in flashbacks we see someone not quite of this world. In fact, Sam informs Ruby that he's from the future, 2470 to be exact, traveling back in time to avoid prosecution for his sister's death, and to find Ruby, whose photo he saw back home. Ruby's sure he's delusional, but most of the time she wants to keep him - and maybe fix him. Although he seems sane, maybe Sam hasn't told her the real story: what's he up to, and who is Chrystie Delancey?

TgfYbwYoFU4,Speedway Junky (1999) Trailer | Nickolas Perry,"In this gritty drama executively-produced by Gus Van Sant, a teenage would-be stock-car driver gets more than he bargained for when he makes a pit stop in Las Vegas to earn a little cash. 

Almost as soon as he arrives in the city, high-school dropout Johnny (Jesse Bradford) finds himself victimized at the slot machines by a slick little vixen. 

His journey to glory on the racetrack thus sidetracked, he soon falls in with a group of hoods and street urchins. Befriended by solicitous hustler Steven (Jordan Brower) and condescended to by gay-for-pay stud Eric (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), Johnny gets a quick introduction to the sleazy Vegas landscape. 

At first he rejects his new acquaintances, but after a disastrous liaison with a buxom young lady (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen), he finds himself the reluctant new best friend of the besotted Steven. Adamantly professing his own heterosexuality, Johnny tries to find female clients to bankroll his ticket out of town. But soon Eric arrives, promising big bucks from his wealthy male patrons, setting the stage for conflict with Steven and unexpected bloodshed. 

Shown during the Panorama program at the 1999 International Berlin Film Festival, Speedway Junky was the debut feature from writer/director Nickolas Perry. Daryl Hannah co-stars as an older ex-prostitute who serves as a sort of foster mother for both Johnny and Steven. 

The film also marked the acting debut of musical artist Warren G and features a cameo appearance from Patsy Kensit.",5532,22,3,161,0,0.3612

FHVpgT0UuDg,Sidewalks of New York Trailer,"An intricate web of relationships is examined by Ed Burns (THE BROTHERS McMULLEN, SHE'S THE ONE) in SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK. Burns, who also wrote and produced the film, stars as Tommy Reilly, a boy from Queens turned successful Manhattanite. After being kicked out of the apartment he shared with his girlfriend, he is back in the dating scene. When he meets a divorced schoolteacher, the connections between the additional main characters in the ensemble are identified slowly but surely: a divorced couple, an adulterous married man and his mistress, and a doubting wife. Burns' look at relationships leaves no stone unturned as the main characters and their friends discuss their love lives. Filmed throughout New York City, the characters' stories are spliced together by their own personal monologues in documentary-style scenes. Well-delivered, witty, and humorous banter that is reminiscent of the works of Woody Allen keeps the story moving, as does the shooting technique of following behind the characters with the camera. Tucci, in particular, delivers a standout performance as a two-timing, lecherous dentist.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A couple experiences love at first sight and leaves it up to destiny to bring them back together again.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After the long-delayed Town and Country, director Peter Chelsom turns in his second 2001 effort with this love-at-first-sight romantic comedy that revolves around fate, destiny, and chance. Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) are two New Yorkers already in relationships when they meet one another, each reaching for the last pair of cashmere gloves at a department store. Over coffee, they strike up an intimate conversation, and Jonathan thinks they should see each other again. Unconvinced, Sara arranges an elaborate series of ""fate"" games; if they're meant to be together, she reasons, she and Jonathan will receive some sort of sign in the future. Flash forward several years, and the two are at opposite ends of the country -- Jonathan in New York and Sara in San Francisco, both engaged to be married. Still, neither can shake the memory of their chance encounter, and they both enlist their best friends (Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven) to help them find their true love again. Serendipity had its Gala World Premiere at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.

jj-MbKZliwo,"IRON MONKEY - Trailer (1993) - Platinum Edition  - Donnie Yen, Yu Rong Guang, Yuen Woo Ping","TODAY's upload is a fast paced trailer for Platinum edition DVD release of Hong Kong martial arts adventure - IRON MONKEY.  Trailer is in my oppinion nicely done with fine music background and atmospheric voice narration.  Movie is worth it - especially if you like martial arts movies in wuxia style and watch the Platinum edition that includes many bonuses and infos about HK cinema and cast. This one is really one of HK LEGENDS :-).

Iron Monkey is a 1993 Hong Kong movie by director and martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo Ping (later become widely famous in the west through his Matrix work). Produced by Tsui Hark.

For this breathtaking epic adventure set in late Ching dynasty, acclaimed action director Yuen Woo-ping combines incredible dynamic, high-flying fight-action and stunning cinematography with a classic wuxia story of courage, honour and sacrifice. 

International action superstars Donnie Yen and Yu Rong Kwong give nice performances as two legendary warriors who must put their lives on the line to defeat the barbaric excesses of a corrupt political regime and protect the lives of the people and child who later becomes ""The Legend"" Wong Fei Hong. 

The DVD with many nice bonuses in this Platinum edition is worth seeing. Movie is not as ambitious as ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, including some comedy sequences but avoiding non-sensical sense of humour. Despite its qualities, Iron Monkey was unfortunately a flop at the HK box office.

Built around intimately-told personal stories of Hasidic and Orthodox Jews who are gay or lesbian, the film portrays a group of people who face a profound dilemma -- how to reconcile their passionate love of Judaism and the Divine with the drastic Biblical prohibitions that forbid homosexuality.


""Tremendo Antes de Deus"" é um documentário sem precedentes que abala os pressupostos sobre a fé, a sexualidade, e o fundamentalismo religioso.

XmKvxQ_itl8,HELL UP IN HARLEM TRAILER Fred Williamson Gloria Hendry 1973,"This hastily assembled sequel to the blaxploitation hit Black Caesar downplays the gritty drama of that film to create a pure action tale with a comic book flavor. The story begins with badly wounded crimelord Tommy Gibbs (Fred Williamson) escaping an assassination attempt masterminded by corrupt District Attorney DiAngelo (Gerald Gordon) with the help of his estranged father, Papa Gibbs (Julius Harris). When DiAngelo's thugs attempt to kill him, Papa fights back and joins his son's criminal organization, a move that angers Gibb's top henchman Zach (Tony King). As Tommy and Papa build up their criminal empire, Zach secretly plots against them with DiAngelo. Zach also murders Helen (Gloria Hendry), Tommy's traitorous ex-wife, and pins in it on Papa to drive a wedge between them. Tommy gives up his New York crime operation and runs off to California. Papa takes over the operation, only to get killed by Zach during a fistfight. Angered by his father's death, Tommy returns to settle the score with Zach and DiAngelo. Hell up in Harlem delivers plenty of action set pieces and did fairly well at the box office, but lacks the consistency and the dramatic punch that made Black Caesar so memorable. As a result, it is considered to be one of Larry Cohen's lesser efforts. ~ Donald Guarisco, All Movie Guide",71208,284,24,129,0,0.06360454545454546

Now, Voyager is all three, as well as a Bette Davis career milestone, resulting in her sixth Best Actress Oscar nomination. She magically plays Charlotte Vale, a spinster who defies her domineering mother (fellow Oscar nominee Gladys Cooper) to discover love, heartbreak and eventual contentment.

More magic is generated by a top-notch ensemble, Max Steiner?s Academy Award-winning score and an improvised moment by Paul Henreid that became an instant classic: he lights two cigarettes at once and hands one to Davis. For the ultimate in romantic melodrama, it?s Now Voyager now, then and forever. #Trailer #WB",138334,0,6,135,0,0.52326

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a small village in the Shire a young Hobbit named Frodo (Elijah Wood) has been entrusted with an ancient Ring. Now he must embark on an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval ""Middle-earth"" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the ""One Ring,"" a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson's native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).

_____________________________________________________________
It's the off-season at the lonely Beauregard Hotel in Bournemoth, and only the long-term tenants are still in residence. Life at the Beauregard is stirred up, however, when the beautiful Ann Shankland arrives to see her alcoholic ex-husband, John Malcolm, who is secretly engaged to Pat Cooper, the woman who runs the hotel. Meanwhile, snobbish Mrs Railton-Bell discovers that the kindly if rather doddering Major Pollock is not what he appears to be. The news is particularly shocking for her frail daughter, Sibyl, who is secretly in love with the Major. (Patrick Sullivan, Imdb)

-WillSmithMovies-

- Forget What You Think You Know
- The Champ is here!

Will Smith spent approximately one year learning all aspects of Ali's life. These included boxing training, Islamic studies and dialect training (to help him speak like Ali). Smith has said that his portrayal of Ali is his proudest work to date.

One of the selling points of the film is the realism of the fight scenes. All of the boxers in the film are in fact former or current world heavyweight champions. It was quickly decided that 'Hollywood fighting' - passing the fist (or foot) between the camera and the face to create the illusion of a hit - would not be used in favor of actual boxing. The only limitation placed upon the fighters was for Charles Shufford (who plays George Foreman). He was permitted to hit Will Smith as hard as he could, so long as he did not actually knock the actor out.

Muhammad Ali from 1964 to 1974, told in three braided threads. The boxer: from becoming champion to regaining the championship. Religion and politics: Cassius Clay becomes a Black Muslim, truncates a friendship with Malcolm X, perhaps is Elijah Muhammad's pawn, refuses induction into the US military, and faces a five year prison sentence while his case goes to the Supreme Court. Family: he marries twice and by 1974 marriage two is strained, defends his white trainer, has a brother in Bundini Brown, and is wily with Howard Cosell. Throughout, Ali keeps his own counsel: in the ring, at the induction center when he won't step forward, and in friendship, love, and victory.

In 1964, a brash new pro boxer, fresh from his olympic gold medal victory, explodes on to the scene, Cassius Clay. Bold and outspoken, he cuts an entirely new image for African American's in sport with his proud public self confidence with his unapologetic belief that he is the greatest boxer of all time. To his credit, he sets out to prove that with his highly agile and forceful style soon making him a formidable boxer who soon claims the heavyweight championship. His personal life is no less noteworthy with his allegiance to the Nation of Islam, his friendship with the controversial Malcolm X and his abandonment of his slave name in favour of Muhammad Ali stirring up controversy. Yet, at the top of his game, both Ali's personal and professional lives face the ultimate test with the military draft rules are changed, making him eligible for military induction during the Vietnam War. Despite the fact that he could easily agree to a sweetheart deal that would have meant an easy tour of duty for himself, Ali refuses to submit on principle to cooperate in an unjust war for a racist nation that treated his people so poorly. The cost of that stand is high as he finds himself unable to legally box in his own country while his case is contested in court. What follows is a battle for a man who would sacrifice so much for what he believes in and a comeback that would cement his legend as one of the great sports figures of all time.

Smith had to gain a significant amount of weight to look the part of Muhammad Ali. His current physique is due to the weight gains he had to make for Ali.

_DTswS-j8U4,Presque Rien / Come Undon (2000) - Movie Trailer,"'Presque Rien' ('Come Undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director Sébastien Lifshitz (with the collaboration of writer Stéphane Bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'Wild Side'). As we come to understand Lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable. By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now, time passed, time reflective, time imagined, time alone - Lifshitz makes his tales more personal, involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses. It takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film.

Mathieu (handsome and gifted Jérémie Elkaïm) is visiting the seaside for a holiday, a time to allow his mother (Dominique Reymond) to struggle with her undefined illness, cared for by the worldly and wise Annick (Marie Matheron) and accompanied by his sister Sarah (Laetitia Legrix): their distant father has remained at home for business reasons. Weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of Mathieu alone, looking depressed, riding trains, speaking to someone in a little recorder. We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.

While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him, and we can feel Mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion. The youth Cédric (Stéphane Rideau) follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction. Soon Cédric approaches Mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession. Mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking, rebuffs Cédric's public approaches, but continues to seek him out for consignations. The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, so very necessary to understanding this story, is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes. Yet as the summer wears on Mathieu, a committed student, realizes that Cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival. It becomes apparent that Cédric is the Dionysian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one: in a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while Cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking.

Mathieu is a complex person, coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father, a fear of his burgeoning sexuality, and his nascent passion for Cédric. Their moments of joy are disrupted by Cédric's admission of infidelity and Mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways. Time passes, family changes are made, and Mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt. The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace, strangely enough, in one of Cédric's past lovers Pierre (Nils Ohlund) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.

After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful. Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passion's powers found in love, and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative. Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making. In French with English subtitles. Highly Recommended.

Patrick Swayze plays the concerned commander who befriends English-speaking refugee Tai Tran (Don Duong) and hires him as camp manager. His little nephew Minh (Trung Nguyen) and niece Anh (Jennifer Tran) are anxiously awaiting the arrival of their mother, who was left behind during the evacuation. Fortunately, Minh finds a friend in the camp cook (Forest Whitaker), and together they paint a colorful mural on the kitchen wall. Meanwhile, another refugee, Duc (Billinjer Tran), tries hard to embrace the American way of life, but finds heartbreak when he discovers his lost love (Kathleen Luong) is also at the camp, now the second wife of another man. Time passes and everyone listens to the fall of Saigon over the radio while waiting to be assimilated, like it or not, into their strange new homeland. Directed by Timothy Linh Bui, this is a stately, mournful series of vignettes that brings healing attention to an aspect of the Vietnam War some may have forgotten.

From the South Bronx in the 1970's to San Francisco now, the world's best scratchers, beat-diggers, party-rockers, and producers wax poetic on beats, breaks, battles, and the infinite possibilities of vinyl.

Scratch starts with an origin story. Grand Wizard Theodore (the ""Thomas Edison of the movement"") recalls the day, way back in 1975, when his grandmother told him to turn down the music he was making in front of his Bronx River Houses apartment. In order to hear her, he put his hand on the turntable, holding the record in place. As he moved his hand, slightly, a new sound rose up. And so, he smiles, scratching was born.

xrULisYzCpw,Jessica Bendinger on THE BAD NEWS BEARS,"Michael Ritchie’s 1976 comedy about a squad of underachieving Little Leaguers and their boozing coach (played by a rumpled Walter Matthau) is a bracing antidote to most of today’s carefully vetted family-friendly feel good films. Ritchie’s uniquely warmhearted but unsentimental take on his crew of misfits allows even the most peripheral of characters their own memorable moments. Rowdy, profane and, happily, avoiding the cheap theatrics of the triumphant finale usually found in sports films, The Bad News Bears is yet another wonderfully unruly example of the lost, lamented 70s cinema. Forty years later, The Daily News chats with cast and crew on  the  anniversary of Ritchie’s film.

Brit Clive Donner may have seemed an odd choice to direct, but in all probability nobody else would have been able to impose much personality on this generic Universal Studios project, which plays out pretty much like a TV movie despite the strenuous efforts of star Don Adams and some occasionally funny supporting players. Fans of the show still like this one, though.

The screwball who-will-marry-who antics of The Philadelphia Story are given a gay update for the 90's in this deliriously romantic comedy. Bob (Arquette) has a mad crush on college frat boy room-mate Brendan (Maelan). Brendan finds out, freaks out and sleeps with Sarah.

Five years later they and college chums all reunite for a wedding. As everyone parties and consumes just enough booze, libidos are inflamed and inhibitions are lowered.

Is the bedroom-eyed Brendan really longing for Bob? Will Sarah bed Brendan, if only for old times' sake? Will Sterling marry Bob and get his hoped-for themed wedding? The disastrous possibilities make for great, hilarious comedy.",51677,138,5,129,0,0.43672500000000003

Dueling Banjos. Woody Allen. The Muppet Show. Johnny Carson. Jersey Boys. If you don't know what they have in common, it's time you made the acquaintance of Marshall Brickman. Fresh from his successful series of screenplay collaborations with Woody Allen (Sleeper, Annie Hall, Manhattan) musician and comedy scribe Brickman moved into the director's chair with Simon. The tale of a brainwashed psychologist (played by the great Alan Arkin) who gets boondoggled by a group of geniuses in a think tank who would rather amuse themselves than solve global problems. They manage to convince Simon that he is really a space alien, but Simon gets away from them, taking refuge in a commune led by a former television executive (Adolph Green) who worships TV Guide. And soon the Army is after the escaped ""alien"" with orders to shoot on sight. Featuring Wallace Shawn, Fred Gwynne, and Madeline Kahn.

Using a mix of film of the Zephyr skateboard team (Z-Boys) shot in the 1970s by Craig Stecyk, along with contemporary interviews, the documentary tells the story of a group of teenage surfer/skateboarders and their influence on the history of skateboarding (and to a lesser extent surfing) culture.

In the 1850s two British officers, Captain Richard Burton (Patrick Bergin, Patriot Games), a womanising anthropologist and Lt. John Speke (Iain Glen, Game of Thrones), an aristocrat with a pending book deal, embarked on an awe-inspiring adventure to discover the source of the great Nile River.
 
Warned of the many dangers ahead of them, the two pioneers attempted to make history, as the first ever Westerners to venture deep into the untamed African wilderness and document their findings. Along the way, their exploits become the stuff of legend - experiencing a fearsome lion attack,  challenged by the complexities of communicating with the natives and observing the sheer beauty and grace of the greater African landscape.
But as the difficult journey takes its toll on the two intrepid explorers, their friendship is tested to the limits of conflict and pushed to the point of betrayal.
 
Based on William Harrison's epic historical novel, directed by Oscar® nominee Bob Rafelson (Five Easy Pieces) and with breathtaking photography from nine-time Oscar® nominee Roger Deakins,  Mountains Of The Moon also features Richard E.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Connie (Diane Lane) learns that she is not the only woman in Paul's (Olivier Martinez) life.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Diane Lane is a wayward wife and Richard Gere is her suspicious husband in Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful. Connie (Lane) leaves her suburban home on an errand, venturing into Manhattan during a wicked windstorm. On a trash-strewn Soho street, she literally runs into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a handsome young Frenchman carrying a huge stack of books. Connie has a bad scrape on her knee, and is unable to get a cab, so Paul invites her up to his apartment. Paul is quietly flirtatious as he gives Connie some ice and a bandage for her knee. Connie phones home and explains to her son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), that she's running late. Before she leaves, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. She mentions the encounter in passing to Edward (Gere), her husband, but it's clear that she's obsessing about Paul, and soon she's back in the city, with a pretext for calling him up. Soon, they are lovers, and they grow bolder and bolder in their passion. Edward begins to suspect, and eventually gets a private investigator (Dominic Chianese of The Sopranos) to follow Connie. His worst fears confirmed, Edward decides to confront Paul, a decision that will come to haunt him. While the screenplay for Unfaithful is credited to Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) and William Broyles Jr. (Cast Away), the inspiration for Lyne's film came from Claude Chabrol's acclaimed 1969 film La Femme Infidele.

Papa Hussein, mistakenly turns up for the opening ceremony at 3am instead of 3pm. He confronts Johnny about his fascist past when Johnny had marched through the streets and racially taunted him.

What might Omar's running of the laundrette be a symbol of, considering the era in which the film was produced?",20552,53,3,214,0,0.7337333333333333

Look for essential character actors Christopher Lloyd, Robert Forster and Dick Miller in supporting parts, but don’t look for much in the way of accurate period detail.

Had another actor assumed the role of neo-Nazi Danny Balint, you might not enjoy the movie. The fact that Gosling captivates you from the beginning makes you intrigued throughout the film, which at times is a bit hard to watch.

ssBUir2LG-U,The Importance of Being Earnest (2002) - Trailer,"Original Trailer of the movie, based on the well known comedy by Oscar Wilde ""The Importance of Being Earnest""
 
The plot revolves around two men in Edwardian England, John (Jack) Worthing and Algernon (Algy) Moncrieff. Whenever Jack travels to London from his Hertfordshire estate he says he is going to see his (fictitious) wayward brother Ernest. Once in London he keeps his privacy by calling himself Ernest. This tactic is especially important as his beloved, Gwendolen, declares that she could only love a man named Ernest. Her cousin, Algy, is the one person who knows Jack's secret and one day he travels down to the estate, announcing himself to Jack's attractive ward Cecily as the infamous Ernest. Cecily is enamoured with him and his name, and upon Jack's return home and Gwendolen's unexpected arrival it becomes clear there are both too many and too few Ernests earnestly courting.  (Wikipedia ENG)

Very well done movie in my opinion, with two of the best english actors, Colin Firth and Rupert Everett, both perfect here in their roles! but we have not to forget the co-stars Reese Whiterspoon, Frances O'Connor and Judi Dench!!
Funny and enjoyable! (look out for the song the two men start singing to the ladies)

SzHOBTbU1Xg,John Malkovich - 1991 The Object Of Beauty Trailer,"Jake (John Malkovich) and Tina (Andie MacDowell) are a glamorous American couple camping out in a suite in a swank London hotel. They're unable to settle their account, which when the movie begins stands at about six thousand pounds, because Jake, a speculator, has blown all his money on a bad investment. Jake and Tina are unmarried and have no permanent address; they're charming, attractive drifters, getting by on style. In a sense, they're throwbacks to the sophisticated and slightly disreputable couples who floated airily through thirties romantic comedies: no-strings types who stick together for the best shallow reasons-for sex and laughs and the shared kick of living the high life without having to work too hard. The picture, written and directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, is conceived as high-style fluff, but it never delivers quite as much irresponsible fun as it promises. It's like a Lubitsch movie without the speed and the grace and the blissful inconsequentiality. Malkovich, however, is as unaccountably magnetic here as he was in ""Dangerous Liaisons."" His performance is a postmodern mutation of thirties style, an ungodly hybrid of William Powell and Boris Karloff, and it's sensationally funny. This is as original a piece of acting as you'll ever see in a romantic comedy. The supporting players are an unusually lively group: Lolita Davidovich, Peter Riegert, Joss Ackland, and Bill Paterson.",62532,120,9,138,0,0.55216

xe9exzTlPBI,"Richard Dreyfuss in ""Who is Cletis Tout?"" 2002 Movie Trailer","Who Is Cletis Tout? is about a crook (Christian Slater) who breaks out of one jail and then has to break back in to another; who gets a new identity, only to discover that his new identity is a man some dangerous people want dead; and who's describing his life to a hit man (Tim Allen) who's a sucker for old movies with satisfying stories. 

The plot of Who Is Cletis Tout? has too much cleverness and not enough smarts, with too many holes to make sense. Nonetheless, Slater, Allen, Richard Dreyfuss, Portia de Rossi, RuPaul, and Billy Connolly are all engaging enough to keep things pleasant.

It was also Mary's fourth and final film under her brief Universal Pictures contract; she wouldn't appear in another theatrical movie until Ordinary People in 1980.

Elvis stars as a professional man for the first time in his career. Dr. Carpenter heads a ghetto clinic in a major metropolis. He is surprised to be offered assistance by three women. Unknown to him, the three are nuns in street clothing who want to aid the community but are afraid the local residents might be reluctant to seek help if their true identities were known.
Carpenter falls in love with Sister Michelle Gallagher, played by wholesome Mary Tyler Moore, but Sister Michelle's true vocation remains unknown to Dr. Carpenter. She also has feelings for the doctor but is reluctant to leave the order. The film concludes with Sister Michelle entering a church to pray for guidance to make her choice.",44686,138,16,154,0,0.4517

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Christopher Gill (Rod Steiger) attacks Kate Palmer (Lee Remick) in her apartment while Morris Bummel (George Segal) is on his way to rescue her.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
New York detective Moe Brummell (George Segal) is assigned to track down a serial killer who has been preying on lonely middle-aged ladies. Each of the bodies is discovered with a lipstick kiss drawn on the forehead. We know (but Brummell doesn't) that the murderer is Christopher Gill (Rod Steiger), a round-the-bend actor whose hatred for his mother has driven him to his killing spree. Gill is fond of adopting a different personality and costume with each killing (a priest, a homosexual, a plumber etc.), making him doubly difficult to trace. When Brummell comments to the media that he's up against a criminal genius, he finds himself the reluctant recipient of Gill's anonymous phone calls, wherein the killer plants cryptic clues leading to his next crime. It may not be readily apparent from the previous sentence, but No Way to Treat a Lady is a comedy-albeit a jet-black one. Moe Brummell is hampered with an archetypal Jewish mamma (Eileen Heckart), who in her own way is as deadly as the elusive Christopher Gill. Lee Remick plays Brummell's girl friend, who, as the only person who might be able to identify Gill, is placed in harm's way at the film's climax. A curious by-product of No Way to Treat a Lady is the fact that Rod Steiger was cast in the lead in the 1976 biopic W.C. Fields and Me on the basis of the third-rate Fields imitation he offers to George Segal during one of his taunting phone calls.

As luck would have it, they land on Halloween and get mistaken for trick-or-treaters. Comedy ensues as the Martians try to get taken seriously. 

When one saucer of an invasion force has engine trouble, it lands on Earth. It happens to be Halloween and it happens the invaders are only about 4 feet tall. As the bumbling aliens wander around the countryside they are taken to be children and they make friends with two children, one of whom is the daughter of the sheriff. As their troubles mount (it's difficult for five aliens to conquer a world) they begin to give up their plans of conquest, but then there is that nasty killer robot.",1464820,7846,832,60,0,0.313132

Brothers Johnny, an adolescent surf talent, and Adam, a preadolescent video-game addict, grow up care-free in California as adopted sons of Marines veteran Mac, inseparable friends of wacky local lout Iggy. Colonel Chi's military reign of terror culminates in their tiny birth-land, island state Patu San, off the Viet Nam coast. Former royal guards officer Zatch comes to summon the brothers to return and restore the pacific monarchy, because they are the sons of the murdered king, whom Mac took in exile for safety. They are joined on the adventurous journey by a bored Californian police detective whose attention was drawn by the ninja team that failed, thanks to Zatch, to murder the brothers in Mac's home.

BmHQjE_YCGw,Murnau's TABU (Story of the South Seas) Masters of Cinema Trailer,"In 1929, F. W. Murnau (Nosferatu, Faust, Sunrise), one of the greatest of all film directors, invited leading documentarist Robert Flaherty (Nanook of the North, Man of Aran) to collaborate on a film to be be shot on location in Tahiti, a Polynesian idyll in which Murnau imagined a cast of island actors would provide a new form of authentic drama and offer rare insight into their ""primitive"" culture. The result of their collaboration was Tabu, a film that depicts the details of indigenous island life to tell a mythical tale that is rich in the universal themes of desire and loss.

Subtitled ""A Story of the South Seas"", Tabu concerns a Tahitian fisherman (played by an islander, Matahi) and his love for a young woman (played by fellow islander Reri, who went on to star on Broadway) whose body has been consecrated to the gods, rendering her tabu as far as mortal men are concerned. The lovers flee their island and its restrictive traditions, but will their love prevail in the ""civilised"" world?

This Oscar-winning film (the Academy Award went to cinematographer Floyd Crosby) is both poetic and simple in tone. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present -- completely unc-ensored and fully restored -- this landmark film of rare exoticism and magical beauty, described by critic Lotte Eisner in 1931 as ""the apogee of the art of the silent film"", for the first time ever on Blu-ray in its original aspect ratio.

k1wpI9YMmeY,Le Fate Ignoranti / His Secret Life (2001) - Movie Trailer 3,"Film making is not about bringing together photography and theater, but painting and music. So said Robert Bresson, and Turkish director (but living and working in Italy) Ferzan Ozpetek shows how this is possible. Anna (a young and rich widow living a sheltered life, admirably played by Margherita Bui) discovers her deceased husband (with whom she was truly in love) had a gay lover. She traces this man, and discovers a whole world she had not dreamed of - just a few kilometers from home. She mourns her marriage for the second time, and is both repulsed and attracted by the former lover and his friends (living in a semi-incredible commune which FerzanOzpetek creates and describes in flourishing details). In the end she accepts this separate reality, discovering it inside herself as well as outside.

At the beginning I was fascinated by the technical talents of Ferzan Ozpetek, and how he interprets other directors without actually copying them: the general atmosphere of the gay commune reminds me of Pedro Almodovar (the costumes, for example, and the terrace in Rome like the one in Madrid in Women on the verge of nervous breakdown). The way of picturing the streets of this old, lower-class area of Rome reminded me of Mario Martone and his film L'amore Molesto. By the time I realized the biggest debt is to Julian Shnabel's Before Night Falls I was so much into the film that I did not care any more, and simply let myself being carried away by the magic of emotions. At the end I left the cinema totally dazzled. (There is a brief scene when Antonio is looking for condoms and unexpectedly finds a poetry book which for me is worth many a therapy sessions discussing sex and affection).

I cannot guarantee that this will happen to you as well, but you are certain to see a film full of art, by that rare director who established himself (Turkish Bath was his first film) not by marketing savvy but by word-of-mouth from casual viewers becoming enthusiastic supporters.

By the way: the connection with Before Night Falls is clear in two points. Both films surprise viewers with emotional documentary footage when the ending titles are showing. Here it is about the year 2000 Gay Pride march in Rome (a national confrontation after the Vatican and the left-wing prime minister tried to have it banned or moved somewhere else).

The second point is even more clear: in both films there is a scene (and a very moving one) where soft, melancholic music is used (apparently out of context) under footage of a loud and roaring party. In Le Fate Ignoranti the two main characters look at each other with romantic longing - while both are engaged (actively or passively) in overtly sexual courting with other partners. Loneliness hidden in apparent merriment is exactly what Shnabel wanted to show, as well.

Moonlight Mile is a 2002 movie written and directed by Brad Silberling. This film was loosely inspired by writer/director Brad Silberling's own experience. He was dating actress Rebecca Schaeffer at the time she was killed by an obsessed fan in 1989. It was partially filmed on location in South Pasadena, California, Swampscott, Massachusetts, Marblehead, Massachusetts and Gloucester, Massachusetts. Neighbor's Restaurant is really Haley's Liquor Store in Old Town Marblehead, Massachusetts.

The film takes its name from the Rolling Stones song ""Moonlight Mile"". The film's original title was Baby's in Black, and then later changed to Goodbye Hello, and then the current title. The film is set in 1973 and music from that era is heavily featured, including that of the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan and Elton John, transmitting a feeling of the times.

HXU9W41mSb4,Shanghai Ghetto Official Film Trailer,"One of the most amazing and captivating survival tales of WWII, the overwhelmingly acclaimed SHANGHAI GHETTO has been declared ""a don't miss documentary...powerful...eye-opening"" (New York Observer). Stirringly narrated by Academy Award winner Martin Landau (Ed Wood, The Majestic), SHANGHAI GHETTO recalls the strange-but-true story of thousands of European Jews who were shut out of country after country while trying to escape Nazi persecution in the late 1930s. 

Left without options or entrance visas, a beacon of hope materialized for them on the other side of the world, and in the unlikeliest of places, Japanese-controlled Shanghai. Fleeing for their lives, these Jewish refugees journeyed to form a settlement in the exotic city, penniless and unprepared for their new life in the Far East. At the turn of the new millennium, filmmakers Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amire Mann boldly snuck into China with two survivors and a digital camera to shoot at the site of the original Shanghai Ghetto, unchanged since WWII. Their never-before-seen recordings--along with interviews of survivors and historians, rare letters, stock footage, still photos, and an orignal score by Sujin Nam and Chinese Erhu performer Karen Han (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)--depicts an incredibly moving portrayal of a rich cultural life, bravely constructed under enormous hardship.",17870,61,9,119,0,0.0002333333333333354

STnWeHx41p4,Red Dragon trailer,"Trailer from the 2002 Hannibal Lecter film ""Red Dragon"", starring Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fienns, and Philip Seymore Hoffman.

Special Agent Will Graham is called out of retirment by the FBI to assist in capturing a killer who calls himself ""The Great Red Dragon"". After failing to solve the case, Graham knows he must face his deepest fear and consult the man who attempted to kill him several years earlier: Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant, caged monster who was famous for his horrific crimes of cannibalism. Lecter seems willing to assist Graham with the case, however, the vengeful genius has more sinister plans in store for the seasoned agent.

Based off of the first terrifying novel by Thomas Harris: See Hannibal Lecter as he was introduced in the series!

TRIVIA:
*A movie called ""Manhunter"" was released in 1986, starring William Petersen (Gil Grissom: CSI), and Brian Cox (Mr. Striker, X Men 2) that was based off of the Red Dragon book. Petersen played Will Graham in the movie, while Cox played Hannibal ""Lecktor"".

*While filming this movie, Hopkins was channel surfing one day and came upon Silence of the Lambs on AMC. He then realized that he had used a different voice for Silence of the Lambs then he was using for filming during this movie. He stated in an interview that he was praying that no one would notice it ^.^' (Fans did, of course)

*Hopkins has stated that this Lecter is his favorite one out of the three that he's done.

*Hopkins wasn't sure if he wanted to do Lecter for this movie. He'd had enough of the character by HANNIBAL, which was released a year earlier.

*The same guy that designs the tattoos in the TV show Prison Break designed the massive tatoo that the killer has on his back in this movie.

*Hopkins had to lose 25 lbs for this movie, and for part of Hopkins' appearence, the original plan was to digitally de-age him so he would look younger than his Silence of the Lambs counterpart. This plan was discarded for unknown reasons, but most people have stated it was a budget issue.",1274382,1525,181,155,0,0.331005

Django 2: il grande ritorno / Django Strikes Again / Djangos Rückkehr

Director: Nello Rossati
With Franco Nero, Donald Pleasance, William Berger, Christopher Connelly, Miguel Carreno, Consuelo Reina
Screenplay: Franco Reggiani, Nello Rossati
Cinematography: Sandro Mancori
Music: Gianfranco Plenizio

Django was a successful and highly influential ""spaghetti western,"" spawning over 30 pseudo-sequels that borrowed the name and the main character's bloodthirsty ways, but Django 2: Il Grande Ritorno (aka Django Strikes Again) was the first follow-up to feature Franco Nero reprising the title role from the original film, and the only one made with the participation of the director of Django, Sergio Corbucci (though only in an advisory capacity.) In this story, Django (Franco Nero) has spent a decade in a monastery, trying to live down his violent past as a gunman. However, Django is forced to renounce his vows when word gets back to him that a villainous slave trader, Orlowsky (Christopher Connelly), has kidnapped his daughter. Enraged and determined to bring the abductors to justice, Django digs up his old Gatling gun (literally - he had buried it in a graveyard, under a headstone with the name ""Django"" on it) and once again begins cutting a swath through the countryside as he seeks to free his daughter. Django 2: Il Grande Ritorno also starred Donald Pleasence, William Berger and Robert Posse; some prints are missing a five minute prologue sequence.",14947,28,13,128,0,0.10227692307692307

1cMkcfL8w5k,Brown Sugar Movie Trailer,"The trailer of a great movie. 

I remember the exact day I fell in love with Hip Hop. (...). Little did I know how much Hip Hop would be a part of my life. (...). Hip hop was as young, naive... confused... sometimes innocent, and sometimes as mischievious as I was.  And as I grew up, Hip Hop grew with me... and along the way it took on all my baggage, my dreams... I felt Hip Hop and Hip Hop felt me.  And I know that everyone who loves the music feels the same way I do.  

For many people Hip Hop was that first friend... the first to talk to us, the first to understand.  Hip Hop has always been that kind of friend to me. And like any relationship... I watched it grow, I watched it change.

The union of Hip Hop to the mainstream... was a hard thing to imagine.  Hip Hop was always this personal regional thing that belonged to just me. Starting with ""Fab 5 Freddie"" and Yo! MTV Raps!  Anyone with a television set and cable box could get a piece of hip hop.  I knew I was gonna have to share... and that was hard to get used to.

Just when you think you know everything there is to know about Hip Hop, it finds a way to surprise you... and remind you why you fell in love in the first place.

So what is the difference between ""Rap"" and Hip Hop?  Its simple... Its like the difference between saying you love somebody... and being in love with somebody.  ""Rap"" is just a word!

I always thought... One day I would outgrow my relationship with Hip Hop.  I never thought it was a ""fad"" like many, but I never thought it could grow and mature.  I thought it would be an adolescent memory I'd look back on... like a crush on the captain of the football team.  But I realize we have more than that... much more.  We have a history... a friendship... We listen to each other... We laugh together... We finish each others lyrics. I dont have to pretend with Hip Hop, and Hip Hop doesnt have to pretend with me.  My feelings have never been more clear, and I know they will never go away.

Buy it here: http://www.umbrellaent.com.au/p-3119-white-oleander.aspx

A highly regarded inclusion to Oprah's Book Club, Janet Fitch's international bestselling novel White Oleander is a heartbreaking study of manipulation and the conviction of love in a life filled with uncertainty.
""Love humiliates you...hatred cradles you."" So echoes the words of cold-hearted matriarch Ingrid Magnussen (Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer, Hairspray). Her violent crime of passion not only places her in jail but sends her fifteen year-old daughter Astrid (Alison Lohman, Drag Me To Hell) on a trajectory of turmoil and self-discovery. In and out of three foster homes in as many years, Astrid's life is a circus of emotions, finding value and worth in the people and places that both surround and confound her. Stretching the ties that bind ever so thin, Astrid struggles with acceptance and her ability to forge an identity and independence within her ever-changing environment.

Also featuring Oscar winner Renée Zellweger (Chicago) and Robin Wright Penn (Forrest Gump), White Oleander captures the essence of belonging and asks the haunting question - where does a mother's love end and a daughter's life begin?",492239,2514,181,158,0,0.272974

Up The Academy (1980) Official Trailer - Ron Leibman, Wendell Brown Comedy Movie HD

This puber-comedy is a kind of mixture between 'Animal House' and 'Police Academy'. Four boys are sent, for different reasons, to a the Sheldon R. Wienberg military academy. The life of dicipline asks a lot of the four geeks. Of course these boys know how to make a party out of the hard times. Will they be 'real men' after one year?

Prominent director of early martial arts films Ho Meng-hua, who hired Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung in those films, broke new ground with the successful horror fest Oily Maniac.  This blood wrenching creepy affair is based on a true story about a thing that comes out at night covered in oil and kills people and covers them in oil.  Besides starring a bevy of sexual beauties like the overly voluptuous Chen Ping and the coyly precocious Angela Yu Chien, the film features the young up and coming Danny Lee (who won international critical acclaim in John Woo's The Killer) in his first horror film ever as the oily maniac.

Sentenced to 30 days cooling his heels in the Duck Creek cooler for speeding, Manhattan playboy Rick Belrow Livingston (Farley Granger) decides he doesnt like anything about small townsuntil he meets small town girl Cindy Kimbell (Jane Powell). The stars make charming lovers, but the film belongs to Busby Berkeley, whose inspired dance direction guides some of the most famed moments in movie-musical history: Ive Got to Hear That Beat, with Ann Miller whirling her fabulous legs around a floor of disembodied hands playing musical instruments, and human-pogo stick Bobby Van's jaw-dropping, gravity-defying hop through town to the tune of Take Me to Broadway.

Winter in Wien.
Kallmann ist Quartalsäufer ... Er zieht durch die Stadt, belehrt dabei lautstark seine Umgebung und versucht, den Passanten seine Gedichte zu verkaufen.
Sebastian und Alex verbringen ihre Abende damit, durch Lokale zu ziehen - ausländische Clubs, Likörstuben und Cafés der untersten Kategorie.
Sie nennen das 'Slumming'. Dabei schauen sie den Menschen beim Leben zu, kommentieren es, und manchmal greifen sie auch ein, treiben ein kleines, gehässiges Spiel mit ihnen.

Pia ist Volksschullehrerin. Die Kinder haben sie gerne. Am Wochenende arbeitet sie als Garderobiere in einer Diskothek. Pia konsumiert gerne, hat aber dabei oft das Gefühl, ausgenommen zu werden.
Pia begegnet Sebastian, Sebastian und Alex begegnen Kallmann, und Pia will Kallmann retten, doch sie begegnet ihm nie.

Wenn man wüsste, was aus dem wird, was man tut -- würde man es dann noch tun?

Writer/Director Craig Brewer (""Hustle & Flow,"" ""Black Snake Moan"") delivers a new take of the beloved 1984 classic film, ""Footloose.""  Ren MacCormack (played by newcomer Kenny Wormald) is transplanted from  Boston to the small southern town of Bomont where he experiences   a heavy dose of culture shock.  A few years prior, the community was rocked by a tragic accident that killed five teenagers after a night out and Bomont's local councilmen and the beloved Reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) responded by implementing ordinances that prohibit loud music and dancing.   Not one to bow to the status quo, Ren challenges the ban, revitalizing the town and falling in love with the minister's troubled daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) in the process.

The Thing serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name.

Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty.  It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien is unearthed by a crew of international scientists.  The shape-shifting creature, accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being.  It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman.  In the thriller The Thing, paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet.
Palaeontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime.  Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago.  But it is about to wake up.
When a simple experiment frees the alien from its frozen prison, Kate must join the crew's pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to keep it from killing them off one at a time.  And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish.",133681,329,36,150,0,0.14286333333333331
dRENbQIuoLU,Lemmy - Official Trailer,"An outstanding documentary portrait of the 'Greatest Living Englishman'.

Lemmy Kilmister is 65 years old this year. A veritable institution and definitive rock God, he still smokes two packs of Marlboro Reds and sinks a bottle of Jack Daniel's a day, yet does not look remarkably different from how he did when he was sacked from space-rockers Hawkwind and formed Motorhead in 1975. He's been declared 'The Greatest Living Englishman', yet has been accused of being a Nazi sympathiser. He wrote 'Ace of Spades'...let's face it, Lemmy is such a fascinating gift of a subject, it's only surprising that it's taken until now for the definitive documentary about him to be made. Thankfully, Greg Olliver and Wes Orshoski have delivered that, following three years spent in his company. Lemmy reflects on a life in rock'n'roll, fueled by drugs, booze and women, with remarkable honesty and roguish humour, and it's impossible not to be charmed by the man, whatever you think of his music. That music is never undermined here, and tour performances and archive footage celebrate a significant back-catalogue that has had an enormous impact on music. Those queuing to pay tribute include Dave Grohl, Metallica, Mick Jones, Henry Rollins, Ozzy Osbourne, The Damned, Peter Hook, Slash, Jarvis Cocker and Alice Cooper.

Directed and written by Piotr Szulkin, starring (among others) Jerzy Stuhr as ""Soft"" and Krystyna Janda as ""Gea"". This is a version with English subtitles.

I claim no ownership over any content portrayed in this video. It is an old production, its copyright is likely to have expired and it is dubious as to who owns the rights to this film now (possible that the original studio no longer functions, plus copyright laws were slightly different in Eastern Bloc countries). I've uploaded this to YouTube out of love for Szulkin's brilliant film, with the aim of making it better known among international audiences. It is quite difficult to find a DVD copy of it nowadays, especially in English-speaking territories.

The story of Margaret Humphreys, a social worker from Nottingham who uncovered one of the most significant social scandals of recent times: the deportation of thousands of children from the United Kingdom to Australia. 

Almost single-handedly, against overwhelming odds and with little regard for her own well-being, Margaret reunited thousands of families, brought authorities to account and drew worldwide attention to an extraordinary miscarriage of justice. Children as young as four had been told that their parents were dead, and been sent to children's homes on the other side of the world. Many were subjected to appalling abuse. They were promised oranges and sunshine: they got hard labour and life in institutions. 

Oranges and Sunshine is based on the novel Empty Cradles by Margaret Humphreys.",90953,146,13,128,0,0.20493076923076922

Their mom-and-pop personal-injury law firm is getting by, but things really get interesting when they decide to take on a case involving Vicky, a local ER nurse, who is pricked by a contaminated needle on the job. As Weiss and Danziger dig deeper into the case, a health care and pharmaceutical conspiracy teeters on exposure and heavyweight attorneys move in on the defense.

BTvoaaE98DE,Machine Gun Preacher [Trailer 1] [HD] 2011,"Machine Gun Preacher is the inspirational true story of Sam Childers, a moving story of violence and redemption. 

When ex-biker-gang member Sam Childers makes the life-changing decision to go to East Africa to help repair homes destroyed by civil war, he is outraged by the unspeakable horrors faced by the region's vulnerable populace, especially the children. Ignoring the warnings of more experienced aide workers, Sam breaks ground for an orphanage where it's most needed--in the middle of territory controlled by the brutal Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a renegade militia that forces youngsters to become soldiers before they even reach their teens. But for Sam, it is not enough to shelter the LRA's intended victims. Determined to save as many as possible, he leads armed missions deep into enemy territory to retrieve kidnapped children, restoring peace to their lives--and eventually his own. The explosive, real-life tale of a man who has rescued over a thousand orphans from starvation, disease and enslavement,

Miss Representation explores women's under-representation in positions of power and influence and challenges the limited and often disparaging portrayals of women in media. Writer/Director Jennifer Siebel Newsom brings together some of America's most influential thought leaders in politics, news, entertainment, and academia, including Condoleezza Rice, Katie Couric, Geena Davis, Lisa Ling, Marissa Mayer, Cory Booker, Jean Kilbourne, and Jackson Katz, to give us an inside look at the media's messaging. As one of the most persuasive and pervasive forces of communication in our culture, mainstream media is educating yet another generation that a woman's primary value lies in her youth, beauty and sexuality—not in her capacity as a leader.

uBmnkk0QW3Q,Anonymous - Trailer,"Release Date: 4 November 2011 (United States)
Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, Anonymous speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds ranging from Mark Twain and Charles Dickens to Henry James and Sigmund Freud, namely:  who was the author of the plays credited to William Shakespeare?  Experts have debated, books have been written, and scholars have devoted their lives to protecting or debunking theories surrounding the authorship of the most renowned works in English literature.  Anonymous poses one possible answer, focusing on a time when cloak-and-dagger political intrigue, illicit romances in the Royal Court, and the schemes of greedy nobles hungry for the power of the throne were exposed in the most unlikely of places: the London stage.

Soldier Robert Miller (Kebbell) returns home from Afghanistan unable to fit back into society. 

Living on a violent council estate and finding work in undercover surveillance, he becomes obsessed with taking down a group of local gangsters who are intrinsically tied to a suspected terrorist cell. Taking the situation into his own hands, Robert embarks on a brutal quest for justice, with devastating consequences. 

Starring BAFTA winner Toby Kebbell (RocknRolla, Dead Man's Shoes), in a career-defining performance as Robert, the film also stars multiple award winner Brian Cox (The Bourne Identity, Zodiac) and Ashley Thomas (Shank). Evocative of 70's classics such as TAXI DRIVER and DAY OF THE JACKAL, while packing a modern urban punch, THE VETERAN is a powerful and thrilling insight into the mind of a man who refuses to back down.",566613,272,59,79,0,0.1840559322033898

Shot over the course of two years, the film follows former SNL writer turned political attack dog Al Franken from his highly publicized feud with Bill O'Reilly over Franken's best selling book, ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"" to his campaign against George Bush in the 2004 Presidential election.

Featuring a host of beltway big mouths including Ann Coulter, Michael Moore, Al Gore, John Kerry, Robert Kennedy Jr., Sean Hannity, William Safire, Karen Hughes and Henry Kissinger, the film is an hilarious look behind the front lines of the media wars during the most contentious election in recent history. But ultimately, the film is a personal drama of transformation, as Al Franken leaves his comedy days behind and moves from his seat in the sidelines to become a contender inside the political ring.

VH6VqnHS_3I,Starsuckers movie- celebrity obsessed media,"Starsuckers is a feature documentary about the celebrity obsessed media, that uncovers the real reasons behind our addiction to fame and blows the lid on the corporations and individuals who profit from it. Made by the same team behind BAFTA nominated Taking Liberties, it will be released in cinemas on the 30th October - unless Rupert Murdoch shuts us down first. Or Max Clifford. And perhaps Bob Geldof.

Made completely independently over 2 years in secret, the film journeys through the dark underbelly of the modern media. Using a combination of never before seen footage, undercover reporting, stunts and animation, the film reveals the toxic effect the media is having on us all  and especially our children. It shows how truth has become a distant memory in the modern news and climaxes with a shocking and startling revelation of just how bad things can get when we let entertainment reach out into politics and charity.

The first rule of working in the media is - do not critisise the media. Well, we've decided to break this golden rule, and if we ever work in this town again we won't have done our jobs properly. A film so controversial it will never be shown uncut on TV, and will pull the rug underneath a string of untouchables.

6.00 pm, 7 November, Saturday. Followed by Q&A with producer Artem Vasiliev

It is the early 1960s. Space travel is still nothing more than a dream and the race to be the first into space is running at full throttle. Aleksei Germans multi-award winning film tells the story of a man for whom that dream becomes a nightmare, as he finds himself increasingly at odds with the ambitions of the Sputnik programme.

A highly personal and intimate take on an epic moment in 20th century history, this film is the story of Daniel Pokrovsky, an idealistic young medical officer charged with looking after the health of Russias future cosmonauts. When one of the cadets on the programme is killed, Pokrovsky finds that he cannot believe in a programme that sacrifices its young men in the name of their country. 

Pokrovskys unconventional principles lead him not only to question his work, but ultimately to endanger his life.

In Pokrovsky, German has created a highly unconventional hero, a man isolated from his country, society and emotional commitments. He is an extremely fragile almost cowardly character thrust into a situation way out of his depth  a Paper Soldier. A genius in his own right, he has little understanding of social interaction leaving him lonely and isolated, demonstrated by his confusing entanglements with two different women over the course of the film. He is far from the traditional romantic hero, ready to fight for his country.

This beautiful, complex film resembles the work of Tarkovsky, portraying the pursuit of a distant dream, away from the politics that enshrouded Russia during this space race.",11670,21,1,73,0,0.0

4uIdqjdmnCc,Preview Clip | The Big Hangover | Warner Archive,"The Big Hangover (1950) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #TheBigHangover

David Maldon (Van Johnson) nearly drowned during World War 2 -- in a flood of brandy! Developing a condition known as ""Liquor Recoil ,"" David must avoid alcohol at all costs; the merest whiff makes him wobbly, and a quaff makes him crazy. Fortunately for David, he has a unique guardian angel watching out for him -- his boss' daughter, Mary (Elizabeth Taylor). Writer/Director Norman Krasna is famous for his modern fairy-tale romances, justly so, often building skyscrapers of screwball set-ups from one absurd element. Less noted, however, is his proclivity for wrapping the sweetness around a serious social issue. Little chance of that being overlooked in this Krasna film, the first of two Liz would do with Van Johnson, as midway through the story we veer off to directly confront racism and intolerance in post WW2 America. But don't worry -- there's still the menace of company parties and toasts to keep the comedy coming.

Directed By Norman Krasna
Starring Van Johnson, Elizabeth Taylor, Percy Waram

HUF8_EhO6vU,Shaolin (2011) HD Movie Trailer,"As feuding warlords fight to expand their power, the noble monks of the Shaolin Temple clean up the mess left behind, tending to the injured while trying their best to protect the poor and weak. General Hou (Andy Lau, WARLORDS, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS) has caused much of this mess with his violent and ruthless tactics that rarely discriminate between soldiers and civilians. When Hao is betrayed by fellow general Cao Man (Nicholas Tse, THE PROMISE, SHAOLIN SOCCER), he is forced into hiding, and takes refuge with the monks (including Jackie Chan) at their hidden mountain temple. As the days pass, he finds himself more and more at ease as he learns the ways of peace, and begins to release his hatred through Martial Zen. But Cao is not far behind, and war soon reaches the temple, where the monks are ready to fight back- with their unstoppable Shaolin Kung Fu.

Muppets Characters
Kermit is the world’s most famous frog, but he has never let international success go to his head. Arguably one of Jim Henson’s most famous Muppet creations, Kermit the Frog has come a long way from his home, the swamp, to become one of the world’s most recognized pop culture icons. From his hit singles “Rainbow Connection” and “It’s Not Easy Being Green,” hosting  “The Muppet Show,”  to guest appearances on “Sesame Street,” Kermit continues to take on the entertainment business. One leap at a time.

Miss Piggy is the ultimate diva, leading lady, fashion icon, star of stage, screen, and all media known and unknown in perpetuity throughout the universe. Miss Piggy has an appetite for the good things in life, including chocolate, jewelry, awards, and above all, her one true love, Kermit the Frog.

Fozzie Bear is the world’s funniest—and only— stand-up comedy bear. From his beat-up hat to the “wocka wocka” that punctuates his punchlines, Fozzie is an “old school” comic. His jokes aren’t always great, but they are delivered with heart and Fozzie’s signature pazazz. 

Gonzo is a multi-talented artist who performs outrageous daredevil stunts. Though an odd looking creature, Gonzo takes pride in his uniqueness and enjoys every adventure he goes on with the Muppets including the occasional space voyage. 

Walter, the ultimate Muppet fan, has dreamed of being a part of the Muppets since he was literally no bigger than a ball of lint. Being the new kid within the Muppets Walter can be somewhat nervous, soft spoken and shy. But, when the need arises, Walter  is also smart and courageous.

The Muppets (2011)
The Muppets (2011) is the first theatrical release from the Muppets franchise in over a decade, and was brought to the screen by the writing genius of Jason Segel. With Segel, Kermit the frog, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and friends are back in full force! In “The Muppets” movie, the Muppets’ biggest fan Walter, a puppet, his brother Gary (Jason Segel), and his brother’s girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) join forces with Kermit the Frog to reunite the Muppets and save the Muppet Theater from being demolished by Tex Richman, who plans to drill for oil in the spot at which the Muppet Theater is built.

Lewis is married to Florence, but young Tessa loves Lewis so completely he finds himself drawn to her more and more. Tessa is soon transformed, first into Lewis' muse, and then into something more; while Florence's jealousies cage her in a competition with a child she can't hope to win.

Es dauert nicht lange, und Soames und Anna finden sich in einer Affäre wieder, die sie alles riskieren lässt. Aus nationalen Loyalitäten werden emotionale, und in einem Wettlauf gegen die Zeit versuchen Soames und Anna, den Mordfall zu lösen und aus dem besetzten China zu entkommen, bevor die Stadt untergeht.

Authorities, alerted to the saboteur's plot, divert the train to a siding, initiate emergency evacuations of the surrounding area and call on bomb disposal expert Peter Lyncort to find the time fuse and disable it -- a perilous task that will unexpectedly grow more dangerous. Three months before he starred in the film noir favorite The Big Heat, Glenn Ford portrayed UXB specialist Lyncort in this race-against-time suspense thriller ramped with tension by Ted Tetzlaff, the cinematographer-turned-director who helmed the cult gem The Window and whose prestigious list of photographic credits includes My Man Godfrey, The Enchanted Cottage and Notorious.

Directed By Ted Tetzlaff
Starring Glenn Ford, Anne Vernon, Maurice Denham

Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren),Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) -- with newest members Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan) aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time — six tons of weapons-grade plutonium; enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother.

However, once MGM executives watched the first cut of the film, they realized that Esther Williams' role should be showcased more, and changed the title to ""Bathing Beauty,"" giving her prominent billing and featuring her bathing-suit clad figure on the posters.

Sinopsis
Dacă „vesticii“ erau obişnuiţi să aleagă dintre sute de branduri, în România oamenii trăiau o cu totul altă experienţă: o singură marcă pentru fiecare produs. De aici şi importanţa pe care aceste monobranduri a avut‐o în vieţile celor care le realizau, dar şi a celor care le foloseau.
Metrobranding spune povestea destinului spectaculos al celor şase branduri, altădată vedete ale epocii de aur: salteaua Relaxa, tenişii de Drăgăşani, bicicleta Pegas, motocicleta Mobra, becul de Fieni şi maşina de cusut Ileana. Au apărut aproximativ în acelaşi timp, odată cu industrializarea socialist şi în timp ce în jurul fabricilor care le produceau, răsăreau oraşe peste noapte, brandurile respective deveneau obiecte de cult în visele şi în viaţa de zi cu zi a fiecărui român. Ce s-a ales de destinul lor, de oamenii din jurul lor şi de micile orașe industriale pe care le susţineau? Există viaţă după moarte pentru mărcile socialiste?
Răspunsul este pozitiv – unele au supravieţuit eroic. Şi azi mai vedem oameni mergând la fabrici cu Mobre recondiţionate şi cu biciclete Pegas. Pe de altă parte, ne-a fost greu să găsim o pereche de tenişi în orașul tenişilor – Drăgăşani. Chiar dacă erau făcuţi să te ţină o viaţă, nimeni în oraş nu mai are vreun pantof. După lungi căutari, un fost angajat al fabricii Finca Drăgăşani a găsit pentru noi un tenis 1001, fără talpă.
Filmările au avut loc în orașele care le produceau, și care au împrumutat până și numele lor.
Altădată mândria României socialiste, acestea și-au pierdut complet identitatea, odată cu dispariția produselor.
Un final trist pentru o poveste de dragoste ai cărei protagonist erau brandurile celebre de odinioară şi oamenii din oraşele mici, care astăzi trăiesc în umbra acestor produse.

As disturbing now as it was then, this horror gem weaves a brutal tale of obsession and revenge inside the blackest heart of all - man's. Walter Huston reprises his famed stage performance as Phroso, a crippled magician who rules over his jungle fiefdom via fear, superstition and savagery. Pursuing his vengeance against the man who crippled him, Phroso ruthlessly exploits an innocent girl only to become befouled in his own net of sadism. Special DVD Feature: UNTAMED AFRICA, an entire feature length nature documentary, from 1933!

But the real star of Model Shop is LA itself; the film is a veritable time capsule of the city in the late sixties (Demy had wanted to title the film ""Los Angeles-1968""). As Lockwood's star-crossed lover, Anouk Aimée reprises her title role from Demy's bittersweet romance, 1961's Lola.

PoAcNdeEf_Y,The Last Lions (2011) - Official Trailer [HD],"Fifty years ago there were close to half-a-million lions in Africa. Today there are around 20,000. To make matters worse, lions, unlike elephants, which are far more numerous, have virtually no protection under government mandate or through international accords. This is the jumping-off point for a disturbing, well-researched and beautifully made cri de coeur from husband and wife team Dereck and Beverly Joubert, award-winning filmmakers from Botswana who have been Explorers-in-Residence at National Geographic for more than four years. Pointing to poaching as a primary threat while noting the lion's pride of place on the list for eco-tourists-an industry that brings in 200 billion dollars per year worldwide-the Jouberts build a solid case for both the moral duty we have to protect lions (as well as other threatened ""big cats,"" tigers among them) and the economic sense such protection would make.

Zachary Quinto stars as a dentist who teams up with a feisty would-be assassin (Carla Gugino) to put the final touches on the plan to kill his wife. Once he makes a play for the assassin's payment, he unknowingly sets off a chain of events that fuels a crosstown journey through the many lounges, bars, strip clubs and the occasional nudist ping pong clubs scattered across Los Angeles.

Under the guidance of the legendary Zanucks, the big-screen version of The Chapman Report was turned over to the equally legendary director George Cukor.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A teenager must choose between the life she wants and the path her parents have picked out for her in this independent coming-of-age drama. At home, 17-year-old Alike (Adepero Oduye) is a sweet and soft-spoken girl who tries to follow the wishes of her straight-laced mother (Kim Wayans). However, there's another side of her that her parents don't know about -- Alike is a lesbian, and with her best friend Laura (Pernell Walker) she slips out to downtown dance clubs where she feels free to be open about her sexuality, though she's still working up the courage to act on her desires. As she becomes more mature, Alike is torn between living the sheltered life her parents want for her, the club-hopping lifestyle Laura has already embraced, or something that lies in between, like her neighbor Bina (Aasha Davis). Pariah was the first feature film from writer and director Dee Rees, who adapted the story from her award-winning short film of the same name. Pariah was an official selection at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.

The team is a rag-tag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick, keeping their eyes on the ball and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team?

It tells the story of a homosexual drag-queen at the end of his career. The cast includes several Portuguese real-life drag-queens, with no previous, or little, acting experience. The story has been allegedly inspired by the real story of Joaquim Centúrio de Almeida (artistic name: Ruth Bryden), a Portuguese drag-queen, and has motivated a lawsuit on account of plagiarism of a biographical book on the life of Almeida by the late author Carlos Castro, who was murdered in 2011.",9266,157,11,307,0,0.06836

FILM DESCRIPTION:
An apartment kitchen: a man and a woman discuss Little Red Riding Hood, their voices hushed, mindful of waking the little girl sleeping next room. Waste land on the city outskirts: behind a line of abandoned trailers, the man silently watches what seems to be a family. The same city, the same man: driving through traffic with two hand-made firing pins for a hunting rifle. The man is 42 years old, his name - Viorel. Troubled by obscure thoughts, he drives across the city to a destination known only to him.

Bje8YuNh4g8,ΨΥΧΗ ΒΑΘΙΑ trailer,"«Δύσκολο να πυροβολήσεις απέναντι όταν ξέρεις ότι εκεί μπορεί να βρίσκεται ο αδερφός σου». Η ταινία «ΨΥΧΗ ΒΑΘΙΑ» αφουγκράζεται την συνταρακτική ιστορία του Εμφυλίου Πολέμου που δεν έχει νικητές και ηττημένους, παρά μόνο ανθρώπινες, τραγικές ιστορίες να διηγηθεί. Χρόνος: οι τελευταίοι μήνες του πολέμου. Τόπος: ο Γράμμος και το Βίτσι, τα πανέμορφα και ματωμένα βουνά της Δυτικής Μακεδονίας. Πρόσωπα: δύο αδέλφια, ο Ανέστης (Χρήστος Καρτέρης), 17 χρονών και ο Βλάσης (Γιώργος Αγγέλκος), 14. Έχουν επιστρατευτεί, ο Ανέστης από τον Εθνικό στρατό, ο Βλάσης από τον Δημοκρατικό στρατό. Μεγαλωμένα στα χωριά και τα βουνά της περιοχής, χρησιμοποιούνται ως οδηγοί, σε άγνωστα και δύσβατα μονοπάτια και περάσματα. Η τύχη τους, τύχη των τότε καιρών. Πολυβόλα, αμερικάνικες βόμβες Ναπάλμ, παράσημα ηρώων, στρατοδικεία, τόποι εκτελέσεων. Μαζί τους ο καπετάν-Ντούλας (Βαγγέλης Μουρίκης), η πολυβολήτρια Γιαννούλα (Βικτώρια Χαραλάμπίδου), ο ανθυπολοχαγός Τριαντάφυλλος (Γεώργιος Σιμεωνίδης), ο ταξίαρχος Τσαγκλής (Κώστας Κλεφτόγιαννης), ο Καλαματιανός δεκανέας (Ιούλιος Τζιάτας), η 14χρονη αντάρτισσα Φούλα (Άννα Παρτσάνη), δεκάδες στρατιώτες και αντάρτες, όλοι τους πολύ νέοι που σκοτώνουν και σκοτώνονται σ αυτόν τον παράλογο πόλεμο. Οι μικρές ιστορίες του καθενός γράφονται στις μάχες που φουντώνουν στα υψώματα. Η «ΨΥΧΗ ΒΑΘΙΑ» είναι φόρος τιμής για αυτά τα χιλιάδες ανώνυμα θύματα ενός ολέθριου πολέμου που δεν ανέδειξε νικητή.

tJEWZ33guH4,Sacrifice Trailer,"Sacrifice is a richly designed and wrenchingly emotional historical drama from veteran director Chen Kaige (Palme d'Or winner and Academy Award nominee for Farewell My Concubine). Based on the medieval play Orphan of Zhao, the first Chinese play known in Europe, the film recounts an epic power struggle between feudal princes, counterpoised with the melancholy tale of one ordinary man caught up in it all, and the steep price paid by his family.

Chen --renowned both East and West for lavish sagas like Temptress Moon (1996) and The Emperor and the Assassin (1998) -- imaginatively realizes an ancient Chinese kingdom and expertly constructs an intricate plot filled with clan rivalries, court intrigue and betrayal. A Machiavellian general (Wang Xueqi) plots the overthrow of the reigning Zhao clan. In the violent coup d'état that ensues, a loyal and humble doctor (popular Chinese star Ge You of Let the Bullets Fly) fulfills a promise to protect an infant Zhao heir from the bloodshed. When a case of mistaken identity has devastating consequences, he ends up raising the Zhao boy in secret -- and meditating a long, slow revenge.

Despite the grandeur of the narrative, the heart of Sacrifice is the very human relationship between the doctor and the boy, who is caught between familiar adolescent growing pains and the gnawing intuition of a mysterious and powerful destiny. A stellar cast helps Chen shape an exquisite melodrama with a surprisingly intimate tone. Sacrifice is a fable of honor and retribution told with the feeling and insight of a Shakespearean tragedy.",76730,67,5,115,0,0.36760000000000004

Never mind energy shortages, potential nuclear meltdowns and economic breakdowns. In the freewheeling, funny world of First Family, the White House puts first things first: reelecting a President trailing in the polls! Bob Newhart stars as President Manfred Link in this zany, wonderfully cast comedy from veteran funnyman Buck Henry (Heaven Can Wait, The Graduate). Plenty of problems cuff Link. His rattlebrained wife (Madeline Kahn) and randy daughter (Gilda Radner) are a public-relations nightmare. His U.N. ambassador (Harvey Korman), advisor (Fred Willard) and press secretary (Richard Benjamin) are experts at inexpertise. Link will do anything to secure a second term. Or will he? Vote for Link -- and for the movie that's a shoo-in for laughs: First Family.

tD2RvKHnlj8,John Landis on GORILLA AT LARGE,"Talk about descriptive titles! This generic little indie, set in a Long Beach amusement park terrorized by an escaped gorilla, was one of only three 3-D productions released by 20th Century-Fox in the fifties. It benefits from an unusually good cast including Oscar nominee Lee J. Cobb (the same year he made On the Waterfront!) and contract player Anne Bancroft, who probably didn't include this one on her resume. George Barrows fills out the ape suit a year after playing the diving helmet-headed gorilla in Robot Monster. Notable as the only 3-D movie where objects are thrown away from the camera!

Synopsis:
David Bourne (JACK HUSTON), a promising American novelist now living in Paris, meets the volatile and seductive Catherine (MENA SUVARI) and immediately falls under her spell. After a whirlwind romance they set off for their honeymoon on the Cote d'Azur. David is increasingly distracted from his writing by Catherine's sexual liberation and erotic role-playing. As David struggles to control his emotions, Catherine raises the erotic tension by bringing David a ""present"" in the form of the sultry Marita (CATERINA MURINO), an Italian heiress, who provokes excitement and jealousy in both David and Catherine. As he becomes a pawn between the two manipulative women, David retreats into his writing, re-creating the story of his relationship with his father, a charismatic big-game hunter (MATTHEW MODINE). As jealous as she is of Marita, Catherine is even more obsessively envious of David's success as a writer, especially if his stories do not involve her. Catherine becomes vindictive and her dangerous, erotic game-playing only serves to drive David into Marita's arms.",81882,60,25,134,0,0.05329166666666666

Bso54TGLJ28,Original Theatrical Trailer | The Las Vegas Story | Warner Archive,"The Las Vegas Story (1952) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #TheLasVegasStory

By 1952, Howard Hughes was fully in control of RKO as the giant screen credits can attest. The Las Vegas Story is as quintessential a Hughes picture could be - Jane Russell appears in a series of low cut gowns and bath suits, the stream-lined glory of the city of Las Vegas shines brightly, and climaxes in an aerial stunt that's as thrilling today as it was then. The Las Vegas Story's MacGuffin plot involves a missing necklace, an insurance policy, and a murder (of course). Then there's a suave and cynical Vincent Price who gives the best of George Sanders a run for the money, a series of steamy flashbacks between his wife, the homecoming saloon singer Linda (Russell) and her police detective ex (Victor Mature), finally there's Hoagy Carmichael serving as narrator and performs three of his songs, ""The Monkey Song,"" ""My Resistance is Low,"" and ""I Get Along Without You Very Well."" Robert Stevenson directs. Newly Remastered.

Set against the breathtaking backdrop of Georgia's Caucasus Mountains, the multi award-winning new drama from rising talent Julia Loktev (Day Night Day Night) tells the story of a young couple on the journey of a lifetime, and an incident that irrevocably transforms their relationship.

Alex (Gael García Bernal, The Motorcycle Diaries) and Nica (Hani Furstenberg), a few months away from their wedding, are backpacking through Eastern Europe. Habitual and adventurous travellers, they get by with friendly smiles and a smattering of the local languages. Upon arriving in Georgia, the pair hires a guide to lead them on a camping trek, and the three set off into the lush wilderness. Walking for hours, they trade anecdotes and play word games to pass the time, or simply allow the vast surroundings to envelop them, until a split-second decision triggers a series of events that threatens everything the couple believes about themselves, and each other...

Exploring the relationship between travelers and the landscapes they navigate, between the guide and guided, THE LONELIEST PLANET is a powerfully evocative and thought-provoking allegory of love, betrayal and the ambiguities of forgiveness.",393156,554,17,120,0,-0.20048235294117647

Why this movie:

First, montage was clever and interesting most of the time (occasionally cheesy or trying too hard but hey, still the most decent Dutch movie recently made), and second, there were moments when it was really fascinating to watch not only behaviour after a traumatic event but just the behaviour of a person when they are alone with their thoughts and issues in a house over a period of time. Also, go Rifka for that performance, and the moments of blurred distinction between fantasy and reality were pretty well-handeled",46842,17,2,304,0,0.0

The new hyped ""found footage"" movie, but this time a grand production. 
The film is about the real mission to space in the 1970's that was canceled by NASA, or as the tagline says ""There's a Reason We've Never Gone Back to the Moon""...
Officially, Apollo 17, launched December 17th, 1972 was the last manned mission to the moon. But a year later, in December of 1973, two American astronauts were sent on a secret mission to the moon funded by the US Department of Defense. What you are about to see is the actual footage which the astronauts captured on that mission. While NASA denies its authenticity, others say it's the real reason we've never gone back to the moon.
Just don't make it vampires again...

d0UN5DW6KB0,DECLARATION OF WAR - Official HD trailer,"Based on extraordinary real-life events experienced by filmmaker Valerie Donzelli and co-star/writer Jeremie Elkaim, DECLARATION OF WAR tells the powerful story of a young couple suddenly dragged from their carefree existence by an unexpected twist of fate.

Beautiful Juliette (Donzelli) & dashing Romeo (Elkaim) are two insouciant Parisian souls whose electric first encounter and rapid storybook romance is quickly followed by the birth of a child. But their lives are transformed overnight when a visit to their pediatrician results in a shocking verdict: their infant son Adam (Cesar Desseix) has a brain tumour.

As traumatic as this news is, Juliette & Romeo accept the battle head on, and with the support of their families, friends and dedicated public healthcare workers (many playing themselves), end up revealing their strengths, weaknesses, fears and secrets to each other, as well as the world.

Shot with heart-on-sleeve enthusiasm and delirious energy, with DECLARATION OF WAR Donzelli and Elkaim follow in the free-spirited footsteps of the New Wave in telling a heartfelt autobiographical story in a lively, poetic style, full of humour, emotion and absurdity, set to a soundtrack to die for.

After premiering as the opening night of Critics' Week at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, DECLARATION OF WAR attracted front page coverage in France and took the local box office by storm, achieving over 500 000 admissions in less than two weeks. Against some notable and high profile competition, the film has since been named as France's official submission for the 2012 Academy Awards as Best Foreign Language Film of the year.",33421,41,6,97,0,-0.06701666666666667

Local newsman Adam Carlson (Krasinski) can't wait to escape the northern tip of Alaska for a bigger market. But just when the story of his career breaks, the world comes chasing it, too. With an oil tycoon, heads of state and hungry journalists descending upon the frigid outpost, the one who worries Adam the most is Rachel Kramer (Barrymore).

With time running out, Rachel and Adam must rally an unlikely coalition of Inuit natives, oil companies and Russian and American military to set aside their differences and free the whales. As the world's attention turns to the top of the globe, saving these endangered animals becomes a shared cause for nations entrenched against one another and leads to a momentary thaw in the Cold War.

All in the name of good television, they voluntarily lock themselves inside the building for the night and begin a paranormal investigation, capturing everything on camera.

They quickly realize that the building is more than just haunted - it is alive - and it has no intention of ever letting them leave. They find themselves lost in a labyrinth of endless hallways and corridors, terrorized by the ghosts of the former patients.

They soon begin to question their own sanity, slipping deeper and deeper into the depths of madness, ultimately discovering the truth behind the hospital's dark past... and taping what will be their final episode.",308655,416,107,132,0,0.055504

One of Vertov’s montage-driven documentaries, The Eleventh Year displays the feats of Soviet technology and construction. According to Vertov himself, the film uses ‘the language of the eye’ as well as the ‘socialist language’ in its documentary depictions of the accomplishments of the Soviet state in its eleventh year.[1] Although the subject matter of the film is quite simple, the construction of the images create a complex film that continues to be striking long after the ode to socialist power has become irrelevant.

Oscar® winner Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds star in the action-thriller Safe House.  Washington plays the most dangerous renegade from the CIA, who comes back onto the grid after a decade on the run.  When the South African safe house he's remanded to is attacked by mercenaries, a rookie operative (Reynolds) escapes with him.  Now, the unlikely allies must stay alive long enough to uncover who wants them dead.

For the past year, Matt Weston has been frustrated by his inactive, backwater post in Cape Town.  A ""housekeeper"" who aspires to be a full-fledged agent, the loyal company man has been waiting for an opportunity to prove himself.  When the first and only occupant he's had proves to be the most dangerous man he's ever met, Weston readies for duty.

Tobin Frost has eluded capture for almost a decade.  One of the best ops men that the CIA's known, the ex-intelligence officer has given up assets and sold military intel to anyone with cash since he turned.  From trading secrets to North Korea to aiding splinter cells, the damage he's done to the U.S. is immeasurable.  And he's now back on the reservation with a secret.

As soon as Frost is brought in for debriefing, mercenaries come and tear apart Weston's safe house.  Barely escaping, the unlikely partners must discover if their attackers have been sent by terrorists or someone on the inside who will kill anyone standing in the way.  Now it's up to Weston to figure out who he can trust before they're both eliminated from the game.",9801049,5999,1470,153,0,0.209526

H9K8f7ilaOY,Original Theatrical Trailer | The Chocolate Soldier | Warner Archive,"The Chocolate Soldier (1941) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #TheChocolateSoldier

Opera star Risë Stevens makes her big-screen debut opposite Nelson Eddy in this rollicking adaptation of Ferenc Molnár's The Guardsman set to The Chocolate Soldier's glorious score. Hungary's most popular musical comedy team, Karl Lang (Eddy) and Maria Lanyi (Stevens) are married to the stage as well as to each other. But after six months of wedded bliss, Karl convinces himself that his flirtatious wife is planning to leave him. Deciding to put Maria's loyalty to the test, he woos her in the guise of a Russian guardsman, unaware she's seen through his act and is pretending to fall for his charms just to teach him a lesson. Able to attain the rights to The Chocolate Soldier's music but not the George Bernard Shaw play on which it was based, M-G-M grafted the operetta's songs onto the Molnár play, creating a sparkling musical comedy that received three Oscar® nominations: Best B&W Cinematography, Best Sound Recording and Best Musical Scoring.

Directed By Roy Del Ruth
Starring Nelson Eddy, Risë Stevens, Nigel Bruce

Kurz vor Weihnachten strandet das einst erfolgreiche Fotomodell Valerie in Berlin. Standesgemäß residiert sie im exklusiven Hyatt Hotel, aber eigentlich ist die 29jährige völlig pleite und verheimlicht ihren Freunden und Kollegen den Ernst ihrer Lage.
Als sie ihr Hotelzimmer verlassen muss, hat sie nicht einmal mehr genug Geld, um die Parkgebühren zu bezahlen.
Fortan verbringt sie die Nächte in ihrem Auto und lebt wie ein blinder Passagier in der Welt der Schönen und Reichen. Mit Charme und Dreistigkeit ergaunert sie sich ihr Überleben.
Valeries zaghafte Versuche, sich ihren Freunden anzuvertrauen, scheitern unterdessen.
Nur der spröde Parkwächter Andre wird Zeuge ihres Doppellebens.
In der ereignislosen Welt seines Parkdecks ist die obdachlose Schönheit eine kleine Sensation.

Mit lakonischen Dialogen und unerwarteten Szenen erzählt der Film vom Abstieg eines Top-Models von der Luxuswelt in die Tiefgarage.
Die Regisseurin umgeht bewusst die gängigen Klischees eines solchen Themas und setzt vielmehr auf das sensible Spiel der polnischen Hauptdarstellerin Agata Buzek, die der Valerie gleichzeitig eine kühle Distanz und durchscheinende Zerbrechlichkeit verleiht.
Die Geschichte von „Valerie"" wird zur Parabel unserer Gesellschaft und ist das Portrait einer Generation auf der Suche nach ihrem Platz im Leben.

Sommer 1780. Auf dem Weg nach Salzburg bleibt die Theatergruppe um Emanuel Schikaneder (Max von Thun) und seiner treuen Gattin und kreativen Unterstützung Eleonore (Lisa Maria Potthoff) mangels Geld, Ideen und Spielerlaubnis in einem kargen Bergdorf nahe der österreichischen Grenzehängen. Dort eskaliert gerade eine Auseinandersetzung der Bergleutemit dem geizigen Bergwerksbesitzer Paccoli (Erwin Steinhauer), der seineAngestellten aus Geldgier in schlecht gesicherte Stollen schickt und täglich das Leben der hart arbeitenden Männer aufs Spiel setzt.

Der Bergarbeiter Georg Vester (Maxi Schafroth) aus dem Allgäu stolpert unversehens in die aufgeheizte Situation und wird für die einfachen Kumpel eine Art Heilsfigur. Schikaneder entdeckt in der sich anbahnenden Revolte schnell die Basis für ein neues Stück. Doch nicht nur die Bergarbeiter rebellieren, auch Schikaneders Ensemble geht wenig später auf die Barrikaden.

Eine kurzfristig anberaumte Freilichtaufführung der Truppe, zu der sich auch noch kein geringerer als Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Florian Teichtmeister) ankündigt, führt zu heftigen Turbulenzen ...

2WtWskZZGio,Original Theatrical Trailer | Hearts of the West | Warner Archive,"Hearts of the West (1975) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #HeartsoftheWest

Before garnering multiple award nominations embodying the grit of the Wild West, Jeff Bridges starred in this true gem
of a film, a light hearted look at the classic Hollywood Western and those who made them. Overlooked at the time of its release by an audience put off by its poetic but opaque title, HEARTS OF THE WEST is a jewel ripe for rediscovery. Produced in the wave of '70s ""Hollywood historicals"", HEARTS OF THE WEST tells the tale of a young writer and Western fan who goes west as a young man and through a combination of crime and happenstance finds himself stepping into a pair of celluloid spurs. Directed by Howard Zieff with Blythe Danner, Andy Griffith and Alan Arkin bringing their ""A"" game to this B-movie homage (Arkin would win the NY Film Critic's Best Supporting Actor award for his performance).

Directed By Howard Zieff
Starring Jeff Bridges, Andy Griffith, Donald Pleasence

On the run in a hostile and inhospitable parched landscape, where sudden death lurks around every sun-burnished corner, Murphy has to use his wits and ingenuity if he is to get home alive to his family.

When Murphy's path clashes with that of Sergeant Daniel Dembele (PRINCE DAVID OSEI), whose village has been torn apart by the reanimated dead, they join forces.

The two desperate men from two very different cultures fight side by side to survive across the incredible vistas of Africa as the world succumbs to the deadliest of viruses.

In the first zombie road movie set against the spectacular vistas of Africa, the Dark Continent becomes a dead zone. A stunningly shot horror fantasy announcing the arrival of the Ford Brothers on the global genre scene, THE DEAD is as much an emotional journey through terror terrain as it is a physically demanding and beautiful-looking one. Shot in life-threatening, never-before-seen locations in Burkina Faso, French-speaking West Africa, and Ghana, including the Sahara Desert, on 35mm film by the award-winning Ford Brothers, THE DEAD is one of the most unique zombie movies of all time.",563369,1552,308,144,0,0.145819

""Goin' Back To Hogwarts"" Lyrics (by Darren Criss):

HARRY:
Underneath these stairs
I hear the sneers and feel glares of
my cousin, my uncle and my aunt.

Can't believe how cruel they are
and it stings my lighting scar
to know that they'll never ever give me what I want.

I know I don't deserve these
stupid rules made by the Dursleys
here on Privet drive.

Can't take all of these muggles,
but despite all of my struggles,
I'm still alive.

Im sick of summer and this waiting around.
Man, its September, and Im skipping this town
Hey Its no mystery, theres nothing here for me now

I gotta get back to Hogwarts,
I gotta get back to school.
Gotta get myself to Hogwarts,
where everybody knows I'm cool.

Back to wizards and witches, and magical beasts,
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts.
Its all that I love, and it's all that I need.
HOGWARTS, HOGWARTS, I think I'm going back---

I'll see my friends, gonna laugh 'til we cry
take my Firebolt, gonna take to the sky
NO WAY this year anyone's gonna die, and it's gonna be totally awesome

I'll cast some spells, with a flick of my wand
defeat the dark arts, yeah bring it on!
and do it all with my best friend ron, 'cuz together we're totally awesome

RON: yeah, and it's gonna be totally awesome!

Dialogue 

RON: 
It's been so long, but we're going back
don't go for work, don't go there for class

HARRY:
As long as were together--

RON:
-- gonna kick some ass

HARRY & RON:
... and its gonna be totally awesome!
This year we'll take everybody by storm,
stay up all night, sneak out of our dorm

HERMIONE:
but let's not forget that we need to perform well in class
if we want to pass our OWLS!

Dialogue 

HERMIONE: 
I may be frumpy, but I'm super smart
check out my grades, they're ""A's"" for a start
what I lack in looks well I make up in heart, 
and well guys, yeah, that's totally awesome

this year I plan to study a lot...

RON:
that would be cool if you were actually hot

HARRY:
hey Ron, come on, we're the only friends that she's got!

RON:
and that's cool...

HERMIONE:
... and that's totally awesome

HARRY, RON, HERMIONE:
yeah it's so cool, and it's totally awesome!

we're sick of summer and this waiting around
it's like we're sitting in the lost and found
don't take no sorcery
for anyone to see how...

we gotta get back to hogwarts
we gotta get back to school
we gotta get back to hogwarts
where everything is magic-cooooool

EVERYONE:
back to wizards and witches, and magical beasts
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts
it's all that I love, and it's all that I need at
HOGWARTS, HOGWARTS

""A Very Potter Sequel"" is an unofficial, fan-made, parody show.


It's Not Over Yet - music and lyrics by Darren Criss

LUCIUS:

Don't ever tell me what I can't do
I'd watch my tongue if I were you
for all we know, you-know-who
could be watching us

YAXLEY: 

[spoken] ""He can't be, he's dead!""

LUCIUS:

You think that's stopped our plans before?
You've no idea what I have in store!
You really think that you'd be at my door
if we had nothing to discuss?
He may be gone, but that is just as well...

So come inside, don't you fret
for it's not over yet!

DEATH EATER CHORUS:

Evil plans!
We are making evil plans!
Evil deeds with evil hands!
We love making evil plans!

LUCIUS:

I know it seems impossible, we've been thrown off our track.
But if we can't move forward, why shouldn't we move back?

Friends and companions of evil and sin:
Think not of loss, but a new way to win.
For what is present without a beginning
to start it all?

YAXLEY: 

[spoken] ""Go on...""

LUCUIS:

There is a boy that everyone knows;
The plan is simple: I propose that
we choke cut the weed before it grows
up and ends it all

Do you follow me?

DEATH EATER #1: 

[spoken] ""No.""

LUCIUS:

The Dark Lord?
Would have survived, had they never met...

DEATH EATER #2:

 [spoken] ""So you're saying that he wouldn't be destroyed?""

LUCIUS:

He'd be alive, what don't you get?

DEATH EATER #3:

[spoken] ""Still not understanding...""

LUCIUS:

With Potter gone, the future will be set!

DEATH EATERS:

[spoken] ""Aaahhhhhh!""

LUCIUS:

... So it's not over yet!

DEATH EATERS:

Evil plans!
What a brilliant evil plan!
Malfoy, you're an evil man!
We love making evil plans!

ALL:

Our history is nothing more
than what the losers settle for

LUCIUS:

So look alive, and don't forget
that's it's not over

ALL:

It's not over,
No, it's not over yet!

u1prqhIq4uc,The Secret Glory part 1,"THE SECRET GLORY (2001) is a documentary (With English subtitles) about the story of SS officer Otto Rahn and his search for the Holy Grail.


""Otto Rahn was born in the small town of Michelstadt in Southern Germany on February 18th, 1904. A solitary, introverted boy, he assimilated the bare bones of German Romanticism through avid childhood reading of Greek, Roman and Nordic myths and legends. In addition to this, all around him the romantic spirit was alive and well in the Rambler's Associations and Mountaineering Clubs which began to flourish around this time. For Rahn, this generalized affinity with romanticism became refined into an all consuming obsession with the legends of Parsifal, the Holy Grail, Lohengrin, and the Nibelungenlied. While attending the University of Giessen, he was inspired by his professor, Freiherr Von Gall, to study the Albigensian (Catharism) movement, and the massacre that occurred at Montségur.

In 1989, Marie celebrates her 29th birthday and falls in love with Paul Speranski. She spends the night with him. When she wakes up the following morning, her lover seems to have fled and she no longer recognizes anything, neither the bedroom nor the voice of the little boy who calls her mommy from the other side of the door. Marie has just woken up 12 years later. What happened? Did she deliberately forget 12 years of her life? Has this black hole freed her from a situation too difficult to shake? Marie discovers that she has a son, a privileged social situation, and that she is going through a divorce. The people around her fear her. She becomes aware that she has used the power she'd acquired over the years against her nearest and dearest. And she has woken up at the beginning of a love story in the process of ending.

Flywheel is a 2003 American Christian drama film about the unexpected pitfalls that a used car dealer can expect to experience if he suddenly goes honest. The dealer intentionally overcharges his customers until reaching a turning point in his life where he decides to end his shady business practices and become a Christian. Alex Kendrick both directed the film and starred in the lead role, and with his brother, Stephen Kendrick, co-wrote the film. Flywheel also stars Lisa Arnold and Tracy Goode. Filming of Flywheel began in November 2002 and continued through 2003 by the Sherwood Baptist Church team. The film was shot digitally to avoid film processing expenses. The filmmakers set a budget of $20,000 for production costs, and used church members as the cast and production crew.

John Carter of Mars is inexplicably transported to the mysterious and exotic planet Mars, and becomes embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions and discovers that the survival of the planet and its people rests in his hands. 

John Carter of Mars will be out in UK cinemas in March 2012.

John Carter is a sweeping action-adventure set on the mysterious and exotic planet of Barsoom (Mars). John Carter is based on a classic novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, whose highly imaginative adventures served as inspiration for many filmmakers, both past and present. The film tells the story of war-weary, former military captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who is inexplicably transported to Mars where he becomes reluctantly embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions amongst the inhabitants of the planet, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). In a world on the brink of collapse, Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands.

Soo Ah (Kim Ha Neul), who was a police academy student before losing her eyesight, believes that the culprit is a taxi driver that picked her up the night of the crime. Though the police are skeptical at first, Soo Ah's acute senses and detailed observations present a convincing case. As more victims are claimed, a second witness, teenaged delivery boy Ki Sub (Yoo Seung Ho), turns up and offers a conflicting account. With her own life in threat, Soo Ah determinedly sets out to solve the mystery.

Strangeness is afoot. Most people don't notice the hundreds of cryptic tiled messages about resurrecting the dead that have been appearing in city streets over the past three decades. But Justin Duerr does. For years, finding an answer to this long-standing urban mystery has been his obsession. He has been collecting clues that the tiler has embedded in the streets of major cities across the U.S. and South America. But as Justin starts piecing together key events of the past he finds a story that is more surreal than he imagined, and one that hits disturbingly close to home.

See it here:
Love & Anarchy, Sept 20th-30th 2007
Kokkola, Oct 5th 2007
Official Finnish premiere, Nov 2nd 2007

Family Meeting tells a unique story about people behind music. The film was shot during the fall 2006, in and around the 20th anniversary concert of the Wentus Blues Band, also on their home turf in Ostrobotnia, Finland. It's a delicious mash-up of backstage life and passionate stage performances.

The film features an impressive line-up of rock and blues legends, such as Eddie Kirkland and Louisiana Red, ex-Rolling Stone Mick Taylor, Kim Wilson from the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Omar Dykes from Omar & The Howlers, Barrence Whitfield -- lead singer of The Savages, Sven Zetterberg and Clas Yngström from Sweden, Eric Bibb, plus Lazy Lester from the States, deep south. All of the above-mentioned guests have a long history with the Wentus Blues Band. The film is about the family meeting of these musicians, where cotton and potato fields, joy, tolerance, and above all the immortal, shared moments within the Blues are intertwined.

ZyHQEG9Qz50,Barbara Steele - Horrible Dr. Hichcock - Trailer,"(1962, Upgraded 12/28/20) Barbara Steele, Robert Flemyng, Montgomery Glenn, Harriet Medin, Maria Teresa Vianello.  

A wonderful Euro-chiller.  This special 2-disc, widescreen edition contains both the 78-minute American theatrical edition (Horrible/Hichcock) and its longer, 84-minute British counterpart, The Terror of Dr. Hichcock, which has five to six more minutes of footage and is edited slightly different.  Both editions are in widescreen.  This film is truly one of the best Italian horror films of the 1960s, wonderfully atmospheric with a terrific music score.  Barbara's the wife of a demented, necrophiliac physician who’s enthralled by the corpses of beautiful women and haunted by the spectre of his first wife, who died of a drug overdose.  The climatic scenes of Barbara running down a long tunnel way, only to encounter a hangman's noose, and then Flemyng laughing and leering over her helpless body are not easy to forget.  Directed with distinctive flair by Riccardo Freda.  Chilling and sometimes perverse—an unforgettable film.  Beautiful color and widescreen, from 35mm.  PLEASE NOTE: the opening titles on Terror of Dr. Hichcock are in full screen; however the rest of the film is in full anamorphic widescreen.

bZHkzAjk-OU,Turkish Cinema - Yumurta (Egg) by Semih Kaplanoğlu - Golden Orange 2007; Golden Tulip 2008,"Yumurta (Egg) is an award winning 2007 Turkish drama film directed by Semih Kaplanoğlu. The film is the first installment of the ""Yusuf Trilogy"", which includes Süt (Milk) and Bal (Honey).


SYNOPSIS

Poet Yusuf returns to his childhood hometown, which he hadn't visited for years, upon his mother's death. A young girl, Ayla awaits him in a crumbling house. Yusuf has been unaware of the existence of this distant relation who had been living with his mother for five years.

Ayla has something to ask of Yusuf . Yusuf is obliged to perform the sacrifice his mother Zehra had been prevented by death from fulfilling. Yusuf agrees as he finds himself unable to withstand the passive rhythm of rural life, the spaces imbued with the ghosts and personages of old lovers and friends, nor against the overriding feeling of guilt.

Yusuf and Ayla set off for the saint's tomb, some three or four hours away, for the traditional sacrifice ceremony. Unable to locate the herd amongst which the sacrificial animal was to be selected, they have to spend the night in a hotel by the crater lake. Yusuf and Ayla are drawn closer together by the atmosphere of the wedding party at the hotel.

While the falling snow blankets guilt, the place to which they are returning will no longer be that old town.

8dwe7GR9kO4,Footnote | Official Trailer HD (2011),"FOOTNOTE is the tale of a great rivalry between a father and son. Eliezer and Uriel Shkolnik are both eccentric professors, who have dedicated their lives to their work in Talmudic Studies. The father, Eliezer, is a stubborn purist who fears the establishment and has never been recognized for his work. While his son, Uriel, is an up-and-coming star in the field, who appears to feed on accolades, endlessly seeking recognition.

Then one day, the tables turn. When Eliezer learns that he is to be awarded the Israel Prize, the most valuable honor for scholarship in the country, his vanity and desperate need for validation are exposed. His son Uriel, meanwhile, is thrilled to see his father's achievements finally recognized but, in a darkly funny twist, is forced to choose between the advancement of his own career and his father's. Will he sabotage his father's glory?

Keeping the Promise
USA 1997

Maine, 1768: Der 13-jährige Matt (Brendan Fletcher) und sein Vater (Keith Carradine) stecken sich ein Landstück ab und bauen eine Holzhütte. Während der Vater anschließend nach Massachusetts zurückkehrt, um den Rest der Familie zu holen, bewacht Matt alleine das Land. Ausgestattet nur mit einem Gewehr und der alten Uhr des Vaters, soll der Junge die sieben Wochen bis zur Rückkehr des Familienoberhauptes ausharren. Matt wird in dieser Zeit mit der Härte des Lebens an der Grenze konfrontiert, während Typhus und andere Tragödien die Familie in der alten Heimat festhalten. In dieser Zeit muss Matt allein in der feindlich gesinnten Umwelt mit einem bedrohlichen Fremden und Indianern überleben…

Mit „Kampf ums Überleben“ präsentiert Pidax das aufwändig produzierte Abenteuer nach dem Roman „Im Zeichen des Bibers“ der US-Amerikanerin Elizabeth George Speare. Sie zählt zu den erfolgreichsten Jugendbuchautoren Amerikas. Das „Abenteuer an der Grenze“ mit OSCAR©-Preisträger Keith Carradine und dem jungen Kanadier Brendan Fletcher in den Hauptrollen, ist ein Film für die ganze Familie. Der Film wurde in kanadischen Wäldern gedreht und lässt in eindrucksvollen, authentischen Bildern die Geschichte aus den Tagen der ersten Siedler Amerikas aufleben. Die vermittelten Botschaften von Toleranz und dem harmonischen Zusammenleben der Rassen sind immer noch aktuell. Das Abenteuer aus der Pionierzeit bietet eine breite Gefühlspalette: Verlust und Liebe, Verzweiflung und Hoffnung, Ehre und Vertrauen. Es ist auch ein Film über das Erwachsenwerden, das Matt durch den Überlebenskampf in der Wildnis lernen muss. Dennoch bleibt Platz für die Freundschaft.",4849,13,1,109,0,0.0

Late one night, Los Angeles private investigator, Ned Cruz (Antonio Banderas) gets a visit from a recently paroled Russian boxer with an intriguing  job offer: find Lexie, his missing girlfriend—and the 30-million dollar stash of diamonds she's hiding. As Detective Cruz sets out to find her, the clues send him into the city's seediest corners, from a Hollywood action star with a dirty little secret (James Van Der Beek), to an enterprising porn producer who takes a personal interest in his own work (Snoop Dogg), and a kinky waitress with an unusual fetish for particle physics (Autumn Reeser).  Lexie proves to be as elusive as she is beautiful and Cruz becomes obsessed with finding her.  With time running out, Cruz discovers the trail leads to reclusive billionaire (Sam Elliott), and his physicist (Jimmi Simpson), intent on recreating The Big Bang underneath the New Mexico desert. Tailed by a trio of cops also looking to find the missing diamonds, and with the body count piling up, Cruz soon realizes that what appeared to be a standard missing person's case is anything but, and could quite possibly bring about the end of the world as we know it.
 
Directed by Tony Krantz (producer of Mulholland Dr., and Fox's ""24""), written by Emmy® award winner Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers"") and featuring the debut soundtrack by The Smiths' legend Johnny Marr, THE BIG BANG is a neo-noir detective thriller for the 21st century.

For 12 years, film maker Leonard Retel Helmrich followed an Indonesian family from the slums of Jakarta. Just as in the previous two multiple award-winning parts THE EYE OF THE DAY and THE SHAPE OF THE MOON, in the third part POSITION AMONG THE STARS, the maker continues to show us the underlying patterns of life in Indonesia. He presents that both literally and metaphorically with his revolutionary camera work. The Indonesian Sjamsuddin family is the microcosm depicting most important issues of life in Indonesia: corruption, conflict between religions, gambling addiction, the generation gap and the growing difference between poor and rich.

1H-2hVGpVPY,Crime After Crime (2011) Movie Trailer HD,"CRIME AFTER CRIME tells the dramatic story of the legal battle to free Debbie Peagler, an incarcerated survivor of domestic violence. Over 26 years in prison could not crush the spirit of this determined African-American woman, despite the wrongs she suffered, first at the hands of a duplicitous boyfriend who beat her and forced her into prostitution, and later by prosecutors who used the threat of the death penalty to corner her into a life behind bars for her connection to the murder of her abuser. Her story takes an unexpected turn two decades later when two rookie land-use attorneys step forward to take her case. Through their perseverance, they bring to light long-lost witnesses, new testimonies from the men who committed the murder, and proof of perjured evidence. Their investigation ultimately attracts global attention to victims of wrongful incarceration and abuse, and becomes a matter of life and death once more.

""It's South Africa 1990. Two major events are about to happen: The release of Nelson Mandela and, more importantly, it's Spud Milton's first year at an elite boys only private boarding school. John Milton is a boy from an ordinary background who wins a scholarship to a private school in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Surrounded by boys with nicknames like Gecko, Rambo, Rain Man and Mad Dog, Spud has his hands full trying to adapt to his new home. Along the way Spud takes his first tentative steps along the path to manhood. (The path it seems could be a rather long road). Spud is an only child. He is cursed with parents from well beyond the lunatic fringe and a senile granny. His dad is a fervent anti-communist who is paranoid that the family domestic worker is running a shebeen from her room at the back of the family home. His mom is a free spirit and a teenager's worst nightmare, whether it's shopping for Spud's underwear in the local supermarket...""

A favorite of Sundance, SXSW and BAMcinemafest 2011, this divinely bizarre and funny tale infuses stories within stories with wild characters until lines between Biblical tales, Mark Twain, and campfire stories are hysterically blurred. From producers Jody Hill, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, THE CATECHISM CATACLYSM tells the tale of Father Billy (Steve Little, EASTBOUND & DOWN), an eccentric young priest who tracks down his high school idol Robbie, an ex Heavy Metal rocker (Robert Longstreet, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS) who begrudgingly agrees to a canoe trip. As they embark on their journey, it slowly becomes clear that the two old friends might not be as close as Father Billy remembers.

Séléna is chief of the Marseille police. Respected and feared by his men, his sole enemy seems to be himself, along with his 300 pounds. Strangled by the bursting straight-jacket of his body, tortured by his past, he leads a solitary life in a large isolated house.
 Séléna is the only person who knows that Elsa was guilty of the murder of her uncle, a wealthy shipowner. Fascinated by the young woman's beauty, he offers her a strange deal: in exchange for his silence, he demands that she dines with him every night for a year.
 Although repulsed by the idea, Elsa nevertheless accepts and submits to the ritual. She's initially aggressive and awkward. Séléna is touched by Elsa's fragility, aware that, like himself, she's suffering from some secret wound. However, he remains inflexible. He obliges her to observe him, just as, for the first time in his life, he forces himself to be scrutinized. He restricts himself to this one meal a day, a meal not shared by two.
 Meanwhile an investigation into a seedy affair, more complex than could have been imagined, reveals a dark family secret. But the most important factor of Séléna's life is unfolding elsewhere, in his dining room. Here at last the suffering caused by repressed guilt can be expressed. It's like a liberation, a [...]

In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet—or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles. Also residing in the manor is Elizabeth's ne'er-do-well brother, Roger Collins, (Jonny Lee Miller); her rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Moretz); and Roger's precocious 10-year-old son, David Collins (Gulliver McGrath). The mystery extends beyond the family, to caretaker Willie Loomis, played by Jackie Earle Haley, and David's new nanny, Victoria Winters, played by Bella Heathcote.",4662555,12118,2295,153,0,0.269768

Estreno: Viernes, 26 de Noviembre de 2010

Director: Gerardo Olivares

Basado en la extraordinaria historia de Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja, nacido en Sierra Morena, provincia de Córdoba (España), en 1946. Marcos tenía 7 años cuando fue entregado, por su padre, a un cabrero para cuidar el rebaño en un perdido valle de Sierra Morena, en lo que hoy forma parte del Parque Natural de la Sierra de Cardeña y Montoro. Al poco tiempo el cabrero murió y Marcos se quedó solo y completamente aislado. En los doce años que permaneció en el monte, entre los 7 y los 19 años, -de 1953 a 1965- no tuvo contacto con humanos, vivió junto a una manada de lobos y sus amigos eran un hurón y una jineta.

i7L8U_I4l8Q,Original Theatrical Trailer | Zip Zag | Warner Archive,"Zip Zag (1970) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #ZipZag

Diagnosed with a health condition that's likely to be fatal, Paul Cameron figures out how he can provide for his family's future. He doesn't have a tidy life insurance policy. Instead, he has the plan of a desperate man: he'll cleverly frame himself as the perpetrator of an unsolved, high-profile murder and arrange events so that his family gets the unclaimed reward money linked to the case. As the movie title suggests, Cameron's scheme twists and turns in unforeseen ways in this nimble thriller that works as a crime procedural, a courtroom drama and, ultimately, a race-against-time suspense tale as unexpected events put Cameron on a frenetic bid to undo his plan. George Kennedy (Cool Hand Luke, Airport) portrays the doggedly determined Cameron. Eli Wallach (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), in the role of Cameron's attorney, shares an effective scene with his real-life spouse Anne Jackson, who plays Jean Cameron.

Directed By Richard A. Colla
Starring George Kennedy, Anne Jackson, Eli Wallach

Thrillmaster Andrew Stone re-teams Shadow of a Doubt's Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright for this bank job drama about a man who goes all out for the big score, only to discover he's risked losing all. Diligent, observant and bright assistant bank manager James Osborne (Cotten) knows all the ins and outs of his bank -- including a few loopholes wary upper management has missed. Despairing of the suburban treadmill, Osborne seizes on U.S.-Brazil extradition (or lack thereof) to provide his ""get out of jail free card."" His daring plan -- rob the bank during working hours on Friday and be safely in Brazil by the time the cash is found missing Monday morn. Unfortunately, Osborne's wife Laurie (Wright) does not applaud his daring as imagined. She leaves him and, in order to get her back, Osborne must now enact an even more daring plan -- break back into the bank and return the purloined tender before Monday morning.

Directed By Andrew L. Stone
Starring Joseph Cotten, Teresa Wright, Jonathan Hale

WATCH ONLINE: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/berlin36

Hitler's Aryan policies and increasing racial discrimination against the Jews lead the USA to threaten a boycott of the 1936 Olympic Games.

The Americans insisted that Nazi Germany must allow Jews onto their team and specifically demanded the participation of Jewish high jumper Gretel Bergmann (Karoline Herfurth - The Reader, Perfume), who was the leading high jumper of her time.

The Nazis reluctantly include Gretel in their Olympic team, but to ensure that she doesn't win gold they also include a mysterious German rival, the unknown Marie Ketteler (Sebastian Urzendowsky). Like Gretel, Marie is also an outsider within the German team and both athletes soon form a strong bond of friendship and mutual support. But Marie hides a dark secret known only by the Nazi elite, a secret so dangerous it could completely undermine their Olympics success.

It is now up to Marie to decide if the Nazis' plan will actually succeed.

Inspired by true events, Berlin 36 is one of the biggest Olympic scandals.

Y6b0wpBTR1s,The Dickson Experimental Sound Film,"This short film was a test for Edison's ""Kinetophone"" project, the first attempt in history to record sound and moving image in synchronization. This was an experiment by William Dickson to put sound and film together either in 1894 or 1895. Unfortunately, this experiment failed because they didn't understand synchronization of sound and film. The large cone on the left hand side of the frame is the ""microphone"" for the wax cylinder recorder (off-camera). The Library of Congress had the film. The wax cylinder soundtrack, however, was believed lost for many years. Tantalizingly, a broken cylinder labeled ""Violin by WKL Dickson with Kineto"" was catalogued in the 1964 inventory at the Edison National Historic Site. In 1998, Patrick Loughney, curator of Film and Television at the Library of Congress, retrieved the cylinder and had it repaired and re-recorded at the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive of Recorded Sound, Lincoln Center, New York. Since the Library did not possess the necessary synchronizing technology, Loughney - at the suggestion of producer Rick Schmidlin - sent multi-Oscar winner Walter Murch a videotape of the 17 seconds of film and an audiocassette of 3 minutes and 20 seconds of sound with a request to marry the two. By digitizing the media and using digital editing software, Murch was able to synchronize them and complete the failed experiment 105 years later. This 35mm film was generously made available to the Internet Archive by Walter Murch and Sean Cullen.",294077,3464,325,165,0,0.189836

After the dawn of sound and before the Production Code, Hollywood ran wild and free. Fearlessly and frankly tackling subjects and scenes that would quickly become forbidden to a generation of filmmakers, these seldom-seen pre-Code wonders are both revelatory and sin-sational. This fifth volume takes a walk on the wild side with a foursome that sees Jimmy Cagney (Hard to Handle), Warren William (The Mind Reader), Barbara Stanwyck (Ladies They Talk About) and Joan Blondell (Miss Pinkerton) in tales of swindlers, crooks and crimebusters.

This collection includes: Miss Pinkerton (1932), Hard to Handle (1933), Ladies They talk About (1933), The Mind Reader (1933).

Entr'acte (1924) is a short film directed by René Clair, which premiered as an entr'acte for the Ballets Suédois production Relâche at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris. Relâche is based on a book and with settings by Francis Picabia, produced by Rolf de Maré, and with choreography by Jean Börlin. The music for both the ballet and the film was composed by Erik Satie.
For this production, the Dadaists collaborating on the project invented a new mode of production: instantanéisme. The complete film takes about 20 minutes using such techniques as watching people run in slow motion, watching things happen in reverse, looking at a ballet dancer from underneath, watching an egg over a fountain of water get shot and instantly become a bird and watching people disappear. The cast included cameo appearances by Francis Picabia, Erik Satie, Man Ray, and Marcel Duchamp. The conductor of the orchestra at the premiere was Roger Désormière.
In this (definitive) edition the soundtrack was conducted in 1967 by Henri Sauguet.

The man and woman are Adam and Mary.

But Mary and Adam aren't your typical 20 or 30-year-old couple; they're nearing 60. Like many 60-year-old couples of the XXIst century, they're high functioning. And what's more, they do it with style. They deftly juggle children, grand children, work and friends, with all the joys and disappointments that come with married life.

Until one day they realize, to their great surprise, they've entered the senior category.  
And they react to this realization in totally opposite ways.
Adam's actions are as frantic as his denial. He desperately looks for a fountain of youth.
Mary decides to deal with the situation by doing what she does best: taking care of her husband and family. But her ""preparations for aging"", though comically malicious, frighten her friends and family.

A clash soon becomes inevitable and a separation ineluctable. Children, grandchildren, parents and friends will try to reconcile them. But shouldn't they simply trust life to do that...?",78768,60,7,109,0,0.4898

Century North America.

Academy Award® nominee Andy Garcia headlines an acclaimed cast as General Gorostieta, the retired military man who at first thinks he has nothing personal at stake as he and his wife (Golden Globe winner Eva Longoria) watch Mexico fall into a violent civil war. Yet the man who hesitates in joining the cause will soon become the resistance¹s most inspiring and
self-sacrificing leader, as he begins to see the cost of religious persecution on his countrymen . . . and transforms a rag-tag band of rebels into a heroic force to be reckoned with.  The General faces impossible odds against a powerful and ruthless government.  Yet is those he meets on the journey ­ youthful idealists, feisty renegades and, most of all, one
remarkable teenager named Jose ­ who reveal to him how courage and belief are forged even when justice seems lost.",351021,1051,146,152,0,0.21654199999999998

Revenge of the Electric Car opens in theaters on 10/21: http://www.revengeoftheelectriccar.com/screening-dates.html

In 2006, as many as 5,000 modern electric cars were destroyed by the major car companies that built them.  Today, less than 5 years later, the electric car is back... with a vengeance. 

In Revenge of the Electric Car, director Chris Paine takes his film crew behind the closed doors of Nissan, GM, and the Silicon Valley start-up Tesla Motors to find the story of the global resurgence of electric cars.  Without using a single drop of foreign oil, this new generation of car is America's future: fast, furious, and cleaner than ever. 

With almost every major car maker now jumping to produce new electric models, Revenge follows the race to be the first, the best, and to win the hearts and minds of the public around the world.  It's not just the next generation of green cars that's on the line.  It's the future of the automobile itself.

6Q-mAbF7qLQ,ID:A UK Trailer - On DVD May 14th,"This riveting Scandinavian noir thriller in the tradition of 'The Killing' and 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo', stars Tuva Novotny (Eat Pray Love, Stoned) as a woman who awakens on a remote riverbank with a head wound, a bag with 2 million Euros and no memory of what happened or who she is. Attempting to piece together the complex mystery of her past, she soon realises there are violent strangers on her tail and her life is in grave danger.

Also starring Flemming Enevold (The Killing II) and Carsten Bjornlund (The Thing; The Killing II), ID:A boasts a taut Hitchcockian plot that expertly teases the viewer with gradually revealed fragments of information before unveiling the final shocking truth about Aliena's life and who she really is.

BLySFPGG7hQ,"""The Redemption of General Butt Naked"" Official Trailer","Joshua Milton Blahyi -- aka General Butt Naked -- was a ruthless and feared warlord during Liberia's 14-year civil war. Today, he has renounced his violent past and reinvented himself as a Christian evangelist on a journey of self-proclaimed transformation. Blahyi travels the nation of Liberia as a preacher, seeking out those he once victimized in search of an uncertain forgiveness. But in the end, are some crimes beyond the pale of forgiveness?

Dubbed ""General Butt Naked"" for fighting with nothing more than an AK-47 and a pair of leather shoes, Blahyi believed he possessed supernatural powers that made him impervious to bullets. The General and his army of child soldiers are said to have killed thousands during Liberia's horrific civil war. Following a dramatic conversion to Christianity, the General abruptly laid down his weapons in 1996, leaving behind his soldiers, his country and a war that would rage for another seven years.

Today, Blahyi is on a quest for redemption: facing those he once terrorized, preaching where he once murdered, and trying to rebuild the shattered lives of those he commanded during the war. For five years, filmmakers Eric Strauss and Daniele Anastasion tracked his often troubling path up-close, finding both the genuine and disconcerting in Blahyi's efforts. The film forces us to question the very nature of what true, meaningful reconciliation looks like in a country where justice has not been available. At every turn, THE REDEMPTION OF GENERAL BUTT NAKED challenges viewers to confront hard questions about both the power and limits of forgiveness in a nation searching for healing and justice. Whatever you make of him -- liar or madman, charlatan or genuine repentant -- you will never meet another character as challenging as Joshua Milton Blahyi, General Butt Naked.",39247,125,43,116,0,0.028087500000000005

Deceptive Practices: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay Official Trailer 1 (2013) HD

Ricky Jay is a world-renowned magician, author, historian and actor (often a mischievous presence in the films of David Mamet and Paul Thomas Anderson)—and a performer who regularly provokes astonishment from even the most jaded audiences. DECEPTIVE PRACTICE traces Jay's achievements and influences, from his apprenticeship at age 4 with his grandfather, to such now-forgotten legends as Al Flosso, Slydini, Cardini and his primary mentors, Dai Vernon and Charlie Miller. Featuring rare footage from his 1970s TV appearances (doing 3-card Monte with Steve Martin on The Dinah Shore Show) and told in Jay's inimitable voice, this is a remarkable journey inside the secretive world of magic and the small circle of eccentrics who are its perpetual devotees.

CA5EO4yMznY,Tapestries of Hope,"The most striking element of the new documentary Tapestries of Hope is not the hell that the young rape survivors profiled have lived through, but their unbreakable spirit. The film is a vibrant international call to action and a breathtaking portrait of hope in the face of overwhelming odds.

The WIP will be hosting a special screening of Tapestries of Hope on December 3, 2009 at the Community School of Music and Arts in Mountain View, California. Director/producer Michealene Cristini Risley will be in attendance with the documentarys principal subject Betty Makoni, founder of Girl Child Network (GCN).
In 2007 Risley, a sexual abuse survivor herself, traveled to Zimbabwe to film Makoni and the young rape survivors at the GCN. The girls  some as young as three years-old  are all victims of sexual abuse, motivated in large part by the belief that having sex with a virgin will cure a man of HIV/AIDS. This ideology is propagated by Zimbabwes traditional healers who tout the curative properties of virgin blood, a myth held in many parts of Africa.

In the economically and politically bankrupt country of Zimbabwe, young rape survivors are ostracized by their families after being victimized. Many contract HIV/AIDS and find themselves impregnated by their rapists. Makonis GCN is a beacon of hope for these girls to find support and realize their dreams through education.

For women, life in Zimbabwe is a constant barrage of abuse and obstacles. Genital mutilation is socially accepted and widespread. Basic necessities like new underwear and menstruation supplies are considered luxuries; monthly menstruation is so debilitating that it keeps many girls out of school because they lack necessary provisions. And yet, Makoni and the girls at GCN are testaments to the power of perseverance and hope for a better tomorrow.

While shooting on location, Risley and her assistant were arrested, imprisoned, and eventually deported by the authorities. Despite only being able to film in the country for a few weeks, the footage Risley captured  particularly interviews with rape survivors and admitted rapists alike  is an incredibly compelling 77 minutes.

But Ludek, his son-in-law, employed on a documentary crew filming Pavel, resents that his own family, rooted in Czechoslovakia's Communist past, ended up on the wrong side of history --- while his wife's is now la crème de la crème. When Ludek discovers that Pavel may have corroborated with the secret police in order to silence a romantic rival, the plot thickens immeasurably. KAWASAKI'S ROSE considers the ways in which the past never stops informing the present, especially in societies where secrets were the way of life, and professional or personal success could depend upon a single well-placed piece of information, be it true or false.

From Academy Award nominated Czech filmmakers Jan Hrebejk and Petr Jarchovsky (Divided We Fall), Kawasaki's Rose was the Opening Night Selection of the Berlin International Film Festival, and was called ""the one undeniable find of the festival"" (indieWire).

When his cousin, who has just returned from completing his military service in Israel, tells him he's opening a restaurant in Tel Aviv, Alex thinks that joining him might be the life-changing opportunity he was waiting for. But in order to leave, Alex must quickly find enough money and accomplish his ""aliyah"" (the term for Jews emigrating to Israel) which involves, among other things, Hebrew lessons and connecting with his Jewish roots. He also has to leave behind his beloved city of Paris, his former lover Esther, his lifelong friend Mathias, and Jeanne, a woman whom he's just met but has the potential of becoming someone important in his life. Torn between making his aliyah, his drug selling, his complicated love life and a destructive brother, Alex will have to find his own way and make a final decision.

mzhX2ejdiNY,Amazing slackline routine from 1930,"This clip from ""Rain or Shine"" (1930) presents early footage of an extraordinary slackline routine. ""One Man Vaudeville"" Joe Cook handles four spinning rings while balanced on a slack wire. Theater playbills and reviews indicate that Cook's slackline repertoire also included juggling and sharpshooting. 

My apologies for the poor quality of this clip - it is from a DVD rip of a VHS copy of an unrestored film, and now it's been through the compression wringer.

When Idaho legislator Curtis Bowers wrote a ""letter to the editor"" about the drastic changes in America's culture, it became the feature story on the evening news, people protested at the capitol, and for weeks the local newspapers were filled with responses. He realized then... he'd hit on something.   Ask almost anyone and you'll hear, ""Communism is dead! The Berlin Wall came down."" And though the word communism isn't used anymore, this film will show the ideas behind it are alive and well.   Join Bowers for a fascinating look at the people and groups that have successfully targeted America's morality and freedom in their effort to grind America down. It's not just another conspiracy theory. It's a well documented agenda.


Curtis Bowers made this film because he   hoped that once you saw the facts you would realize what he did after researching this topic... what has happened to America hasn't been an accident.   Now is the time to get involved before the ""Left"" accomplishes their goal of destroying the greatest country in ALL world history!

Set during India's battle for independence from Britain, the film begins with Ava returning to her native land after spending several years in England. Her true loyalties, and her own sense of who she really is, are put to the test by the two men in her life: Stewart Granger, whose job it is to prevent saboteurs from destroying the trains at Bhowani Junction, and Bill Travers, another half-caste. When she kills a potential rapist in self-defense, Ava is given comfort by Communist insurrectionist Peter Illing, further dividing her fidelities.

The Summit directed by Nick Ryan

In August, 2008, 18 mountain climbers reached the top of K2. 48 hours later, 11 people were dead. While memorials paid tribute to those killed, there were also condemnations about 'the why.' Why do these athletes risk everything to reach a place humans are simply not meant to go? With breathtaking cinematography and jaw dropping reenactments based on the testimony of those who survived the climb, this thrilling film is about the very nature of adventure in the modern world.

GLOW: The Story of The Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling 
https://www.netflix.com/watch/70296765 

Guts, glitter, glory... Are you ready to GLOW?

Inspired by the short-lived but beloved show from the 80s, GLOW tells the fictional story of Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie), an out-of-work, struggling actress in 1980s Los Angeles who finds one last chance for stardom when she’s thrust into the glitter and spandex world of women's wrestling. In addition to working with 12 Hollywood misfits, Ruth also has to compete with Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), a former soap actress who left the business to have a baby, only to be sucked back into work when her picture perfect life turns out not to be what it seems. At the wheel is Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron), a washed-up, B-movie director who now must lead this group of women on the journey to wrestling super stardom.

GLOW is executive produced by Liz Flahive (Homeland, Nurse Jackie), Carly Mensch (Orange is the New Black, Nurse Jackie), Jenji Kohan (Orange is the New Black, Weeds) and Tara Herrmann (Orange is the New Black).

Draws signs of magic on my white woman skin.

Africa, charms me with the power,
Takes my soul on the midnight hour,
Africa, dancing till my body burns so hot
Crying to the voodoo god - Africa.

I am dancing bare foot under a red sun,
My sense is high to feel like emotion.
Gazel or panther - I hear a lion roar,
The voodoo goddes fills me with all her force.

Africa, charms me with her power,
Takes my soul on the midnight hour,
Africa, dancing till my body burns so hot
Crying to the voodoo god - Africa.

From heaven opened falling the sweet rain,
From danger hiding between her sharp claws,
A shadow is moving bow to the voodoo law.

G5NNf1lrj2c,LE TABLEAU trailer,"Un château, des jardins fleuris, une forêt menaçante, voilà ce qu'un Peintre, pour des raisons mystérieuses, a laissé inachevé. Dans ce tableau vivent trois sortes de personnages : les Toupins qui sont entièrement peints, les Pafinis auxquels il manque quelques couleurs et les Reufs qui ne sont que des esquisses. S'estimant supérieurs, les Toupins prennent le pouvoir, chassent les Pafinis du château et asservissent les Reufs. Persuadés que seul le Peintre peut ramener l'harmonie en finissant le tableau, Ramo, Lola et Plume décident de partir à sa recherche. Au fil de l'aventure, les questions vont se succéder : qu'est devenu le Peintre ? Pourquoi les a-t-il abandonnés ? Pourquoi a-t-il commencé à détruire certaines de ses toiles ! Connaitront-ils un jour le secret du Peintre... ?

Een kasteel, een tuin met bloemen en een dreigend bos. Tot hier de ingrediënten van een schilderij dat de Schilder om mysterieuze redenen niet heeft afgewerkt. In het schilderij leven 3 soorten personages : de tot in de puntjes afgewerkte Alklaren, de Niafs van wie enkel de kleuren ontbreken, en de Ruwlijners, die het schetsstadium nooit zijn ontgroeid.

oINFeGsyxBU,Are All Men Pedophiles? Trailer,"We live in a society that condemns pedophiles, though biological instinct and world cultures throughout history suggest that an attraction to adolescents is as natural as it is unavoidable. The fashion industry on the one hand sexualises ever younger girls while those who act on these instincts are reviled. The apparent hypocrisy at the heart of society forces the question: What do we mean then when we talk about Pedophilia?

This films broad canvas takes in how our evolution and biological make-up have through-out history created cultures where what would today be called Pedophilia has passed without note, and with the complicity of all religions.  It also looks at how media definitions differ to scientific ones, whether Pedophilia could be considered a sexuality, how the definition differs between modern societies as well as presenting the testimony of both victims and perpetrators.

In conclusion, we are faced with both the contradiction of a society which fetishizes youth and the question: Are All Men Pedophiles?",26556,105,121,94,0,0.05924857142857143

With arresting insight, vulnerability, and a delightful sense of humor, the film utilizes a tapestry of live action and multiple styles of animation as it documents the relationship between Terence (Nance) and a lovely young woman (Namik Minter) as it teeters on the divide between platonic and romantic. Blurring the line between narrative, documentary, and experimental film, the film explores the fantasies, emotions, and memories that race through Terence's mind as he examines and re-examines a singular moment in time.

Informant
DIRECTED BY JAMIE MELTZER
USA, 2012, 80 MIN
SOUTHEAST PREMIERE
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Brandon Darby developed a reputation as a bold and effective activist and founding member of the relief organization Common Ground. Darby was the type of guy who would heroically and single-handedly brave toxic floodwaters to rescue a stranded friend in the Ninth Ward. His mix of charisma and bravado established him as grass-roots activist darling to the American Left.  Everything changed in 2008 when two youths were arrested for attempting to disrupt the Republican National Convention. Darby, working as an informant for the FBI, infiltrated the protest group, and was largely responsible for their arrest. Darby is a confusing, complex riddle of a character vilified by his former friends and praised by groups like the Tea Party. Filmmaker Jamie Meltzer reveals the bigger truths behind Darby's actions through engaging interviews with all the major players and stylized reenactments (featuring Darby playing himself) in this spellbinding and provocative work. INFORMANT allows Darby to come clean about his actions.

Jonnas son Peter ska gifta sig om två månader men en natt försöker han ta sitt liv. Katarina är en ung kvinna som tjänar extra genom att städa hemma hos folk, bland annat hos Jonna. Katarina lever i en otrygg tillvaro tillsammans med en obalanserad man, Asger. Asger är skyldig pengar och tvingas gömma sig från sina indrivare i hans och Katarinas lägenhet. Peter flyttar hem till Jonna för att han ska få lugn och ro. Där möter han Katarina och känslor uppstår. Jonna försöker få kontroll över både sin och Peters tillvaro. Samtidigt börjar hon ge körlektioner till en man som heter Mårten, som förlorade körkortet när han körde bil berusad. 

De är människor som har viktig betydelse för varandra, men som inte är ärliga mot varandra. De lever i en skuggvärld av lögner och halvsanningar och väntar bara på att sanningen ska komma fram så de kan fortsätta sina liv i en ny riktning. 

HAPPY END är Björn Runges bestämda steg tillbaka till den värld av känslor, kärlek, konflikter och starka kvinnoporträtt som belönade honom med ett regn av Guldbaggar för ""Om jag vänder mig om"". Det är också den avslutande delen i en trilogi som går under benämningen Befrielsetrilogin och som inleddes med ""Om jag vänder mig om"" och del två var ""Mun mot mun"". Om människor som befriar sig från dåliga liv.

Fantasiosa, enfermiza y paranormal, con unos personajes aislados de la sociedad que viven en los bajos mundos de la pérfida realidad paralela de su mente. 
Arrebato es una película única en España, heterodoxa a su tiempo y con una curiosa metáfora de la absorción del cine. Con unos personajes que navegan desde una presentación lynchiana a la más altos rasgos freudianos. Ellos son usufructos descorazonados de la marginalidad social, decaídos consumidores de topo tipo de drogas. Éstas son el eco que no cesa en toda la película, en unos años donde la heroína se extendía por todos los rincones de España, incluso llegando a los bolsillos más solventes.

fhdD4XRB-js,The Mark 1961 Trailer,"Stuart Whitman received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a tormented sexual psychopath in this hard-hitting 1961 British psychological crime drama.
 
Three years ago, Jim Fuller (Stuart Whitman) attempted to assault a young girl. Now he's out on the streets again, thanks to the recommendation of his psychiatrist Dr McNally (Oscar winner Rod Steiger*).
 
Fuller moves to a new town, gets a new job and tries to rebuild his life. But then the flashbacks start -- and the nightmares. As he struggles with his past, he falls in love with a work colleague, Ruth (Maria Schell) -- not knowing she has a 10-year-old daughter of her own...
 
And when a young girl is murdered in the town, suspicion once again falls upon Fuller and his life starts to fall apart...
 
Widely regarded as one of the best psychological dramas ever made, The Mark features a distinguished supporting cast which includes Donald Wolfit and Maurice Denham. The film has been digitally restored and remastered by 20th Century Fox for its first ever release on UK DVD.

Impact Partners presents PANDORA'S PROMISE, the groundbreaking new film by Academy-Award®-nominated director Robert Stone. The atomic bomb and meltdowns like Fukushima have made nuclear power synonymous with global disaster. But what if we've got nuclear power wrong? An audience favorite at the Sundance Film Festival, PANDORA'S PROMISE asks whether the one technology we fear most could save our planet from a climate catastrophe, while providing the energy needed to lift billions of people in the developing world out of poverty. In his controversial new film, Stone tells the intensely personal stories of environmentalists and energy experts who have undergone a radical conversion from being fiercely anti to strongly pro-nuclear energy, risking their careers and reputations in the process. Stone exposes this controversy within the environmental movement head-on with stories of defection by heavy weights including Stewart Brand, Richard Rhodes, Gwyneth Cravens, Mark Lynas and Michael Shellenberger. Undaunted and fearlessly independent, PANDORA'S PROMISE is a landmark work that is forever changing the conversation about the myths and science behind this deeply emotional and polarizing issue.",121184,580,111,138,0,0.09040147058823529

""Particle Fever succeeds on every level"" - The Hollywood Reporter 

Imagine being able to watch as Edison turned on the first light bulb, or as Franklin received his first jolt of electricity.

For the first time, a film gives audiences a front row seat to a significant and inspiring scientific breakthrough as it happens. Particle Fever follows six brilliant scientists during the launch of the Large Hadron Collider, marking the start-up of the biggest and most expensive experiment in the history of the planet, pushing the edge of human innovation.

As they seek to unravel the mysteries of the universe, 10,000 scientists from over 100 countries joined forces in pursuit of a single goal: to recreate conditions that existed just moments after the Big Bang and find the Higgs boson, potentially explaining the origin of all matter. But our heroes confront an even bigger challenge: have we reached our limit in understanding why we exist?

Directed by Mark Levinson, a physicist turned filmmaker, and masterfully edited by Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now, The English Patient), Particle Fever is a celebration of discovery, revealing the very human stories behind this epic machine.",681163,1666,109,134,0,0.24716491228070175

His switchblade and his anger are the weapons he intends to use but he ultimately realizes there's a better way. He can use the legal system to deport the Black Hand terrorists by proving they are in the U.S. under false identities. but brining that proof to light will put Johnny and the people close to him in great peril. Movie-musical great Gene Kelly plays the change-of-pace role of Johnny in this suspenseful tale directed by the prolific Richard Thorpe (more than 180 IMDb credits). Kelly had played an Italian-American before in Pilot #5. He would portray a Greek-American in It's a Big Country.

Mr. Bateman stars as Guy Trilby, a 40-year-old who finds a loophole in the rules of The Golden Quill national spelling bee and decides to cause trouble by hijacking the competition. Contest officials, outraged parents, and overly ambitious 8th graders are no match for Guy, as he ruthlessly crushes their dreams of victory and fame. As a reporter (Kathryn Hahn of “We're the Millers”) attempts to discover his true motivation, Guy finds himself forging an unlikely alliance with a competitor: awkward 10-year-old Chaitanya (Rohan Chand of Homeland), who is completely unfazed by Guy's take-no-prisoners approach to life. Also starring Allison Janney and Philip Baker Hall.

Leslie Konda, a talented young French soccer player who was discovered as a teenager by Didier, a small-time agent who took him under his wing, has just signed his first contract as a striker for a major Spanish soccer club. Sadly, he is unable to share his joy with his mother who died a few months earlier, but he promised her that he would take her ashes home to her village in Botswanga, in Africa. Meanwhile, his origins have earned him an invitation from the president of Botswanga, a keen soccer fan who has recently taken power after a military coup. Accompanied by Didier, Leslie sets out on his first visit to the country of his ancestors to pay homage to his mother as well as to receive a special award from President Bobo, who, despite his humanist speeches, rapidly reveals himself to be a megalomaniac, paranoid dictator. They have barely arrived when Bobo suggests that Didier convince Leslie to play for the national team, which is languishing at the very bottom of FIFA's world rankings: the Crocodiles of Botswanga.

Mistaken For Strangers Official Trailer #1 (2013) - The National Documentary HD

Check out the Tribeca FF Playlist: http://goo.gl/HSwy5

Title: Mistaken for Strangers

Release: March 28, 2014

Studio: American Mary Productions

Rating: NR

Genre: Documentary

Synopsis: Hailed by Michael Moore as ""one of the best documentaries about a band that I've ever seen"" and by Pitchfork as ""the funniest, most meta music movie since SPINAL TAP,"" MISTAKEN FOR STRANGERS is a truly hilarious and touching film about two brothers, Matt and Tom Berninger. Matt, the lead singer of the critically acclaimed rock band The National, finally finds himself flush with success. His younger brother Tom is a loveable slacker - a filmmaker and metal-head still living with his parents in Cincinnati. On the eve of The National's biggest tour to date, Matt invites Tom to work for the band as a roadie, unaware of Tom's plan to film the entire adventure. What starts as a rock documentary quickly becomes a crowd-pleasing journey about family, ambition, and the creative process.

At the hospital, the husband is distraught with guilt, severing his own manhood in solidarity and setting out to recover his son's happiness, sacrificed to his parents' conflict. Disfigured in such a radical way, the son slowly deviates from normal life, even falling for the husband's young mistress as the husband discovers strange and severe ways to help his son find pleasure again.

Feuchtgebiete, der Roman der Autorin und Fernsehmoderatorin Charlotte Roche, war wohl das Skandalbuch des Jahres 2008. Das Buch verkaufte sich stolze 2,5 Millionen Mal. Diskutiert wurde über das Buch insbesondere auf Grund der detaillierten Beschreibung diverser körperlicher Merkmale und der ungeschönten Beschreibung der sexuellen Vorlieben der Erzählerin.

Produziert wird Feuchtgebiete, der vom Verleih als eine „tabulose, erotische Komödie"" angekündigt wird, von Peter Rommel. Rommel ist mehrfacher Gewinner des deutschen Filmpreises und brachte zuletzt unter anderem das Krebsdrama „Halt auf freier Strecke"" sowie die Romanze „Wolke Neun"" in die deutschen Kinos. Als Regisseur konnte Rommel David Wnendt gewinnen, der in den letzten beiden Jahren ebenfalls große Erfolge mit seinem preisgekrönten Drama „Kriegerin"" feiern konnte.

Die Hauptrolle der Helen Memel übernahm die Schweizer Schauspielerin Carla Juri, die bei der diesjährigen Berlinale mit dem Shooting-Star-Preis ausgezeichnet wurde. An ihrer Seite werden in „Feuchtgebiete"" unter anderem Christoph Letkowski, als Robin, Marlen Kruse als beste Freundin Corinna, Meret Becker („Boxhagener Platz"") und Axel Milberg („Almanya - Willkommen in Deutschland"" als Helens Eltern, sowie Peri Baumeister („Russendisko"") als Krankenschwester Valerie und Edgar Selge („Das Experiment"") als Dr. Notz zu sehen sein..

They believe in magic birch-trees and in shamans, in the power of spells and the wisdom of nature. Above all they believe in life. And combine these beliefs with a very healthy appetite for sex. The women round which this film revolves belong to the Mari people, a Volga-Finnic minority in northern Russia. They have names like Orazvi, Odocha, Onalcha or Okalche, and all live in the same remote village. The things that happen to them --and around them -- are mysterious and fascinating. One woman's husband can't keep his hands off her, so she puts a spell on him. He falls into a waking coma. Another woman breastfeeds her boyfriend as a way of making spring come sooner. A mother discovers a bird between her legs and feeds it breadcrumbs. One young girl has the wind for a lover and simply takes flight. The story of these wild, strong and crazy women is told in 22 episodes linked solely by the shared location. The women are lead actors in a heathen spectacle so sensual and zany it almost takes your breath away.",31058,84,6,117,0,0.10991666666666666

When the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, Gwen, Terry and their daughter Mako are sent to Japan in exchange for American diplomats stationed there.

https://www.facebook.com/transcendencemovie
In theaters April 18th.

Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is the foremost researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence, working to create a sentient machine that combines the collective intelligence of everything ever known with the full range of human emotions. His highly controversial experiments have made him famous, but they have also made him the prime target of anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed—to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should.  Their worst fears are realized as Will's thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown. The only thing that is becoming terrifyingly clear is there may be no way to stop him.

tPwwlugeUXM,Original Theatrical Trailer | Broadway Serenade | Warner Archive,"Broadway Serenade (1939) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #BroadwaySerenade

Jeanette MacDonald, having just been named ""Queen of the Movies"" by 22 million filmgoers in a 1939 New York Daily News opinion survey, stars in this elegant and alluring, fun-filled musical. Costarring leading man Lew Ayres, it's a rich and fitting tribute to the Broadway stage. Mary and Jimmy are a show biz couple, working the small joints in the Big Apple, hoping for a shot at the spotlights. Coincidentally, they both get a break at the same time; Jimmy earns a chance to pursue his music abroad, while Mary is cast in the road company of a big producer's new show. By the time Mary returns to New York she's already a star, and Jimmy's jealousy over her supposed romance with the producer gets the better of him. This love story, set against a terrific musical score and packed with one hit song after another, makes Broadway Serenade a powerful, triumphant success.

Directed By Robert Z. Leonard
Starring Jeanette MacDonald, Lew Ayres, Ian Hunter

A stellar cast powers this sweeping, elegiac ode to the West. Burt Reynolds plays gang leader Jay, a laconic war hero with a mysterious past. Sarah Miles is Catherine, first repelled by her captors but gradually growing to respect, then trust, then love Jay. With a stirring John Williams score, dead-on direction by Richard C. Sarafian (Man in the Wilderness), and cinematography so realistic you can taste the dust and sweat, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing emerges as one of films great Westerns.

Directed By Richard C. Sarafian
Starring Burt Reynolds, Sarah Miles, Lee J. Cobb

In 2003, Blair was caught plagiarizing and supplementing his own reporting with fabricated details in dozens of stories published in the Times.

Q-oBEGF7uwE,Jodorowsky's Dune Trailer,"Jodorowsky's DUNE will premiere at the 2013 Cannes Director's Fortnight / Quinzaine des Réalisateur

Production underway on JODOROWSKY'S DUNE

It was announced today (May 12, 2011) that L.A. based Snowfort Pictures, Camera One of France and Koch Media of Germany have begun production on Frank Pavich's sci-fi documentary JODOROWSKY'S DUNE. Shooting has wrapped in France, Switzerland and the U.K. with filming to continue this summer in the United States. Picture will be completed by late fall.

The documentary covers cult film director Alejandro Jodorowsky and his 1974 attempt to create a big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal science fiction novel, DUNE. While the ambitious production collapsed after two years, Jodorowsky's team of then relatively unknown concept artists continued exploring the themes and styles started on the project and ended up changing modern science fiction forever: H.R. Giger went on to Ridley Scott's masterpiece ALIEN, Dan O'Bannon wrote ALIEN and TOTAL RECALL, Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud created artwork and futuristic worlds for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, TRON, and THE FIFTH ELEMENT and Chris Foss would go on to work on ALIEN and SUPERMAN.

Jodorowsky, whose films SANTE SANGRE, EL TOPO and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN have recently been released on Blu-Ray in the U.S. and who can currently be seen acting in Kamen Kalev's THE ISLAND which screens in the Director's Fortnight, is excited to share his vision of what might have been, ""Failure simply makes you change your way. And I hope, in this picture, the audience will be able to see what I did. It's an incredible world.""

Director/Producer Pavich researched JODOROWSKY'S DUNE with producer Stephen Scarlata. The two previously worked together on the cult-underground music documentary N.Y.H.C. Pavich also co-produced DIE MOMMIE DIE (Special Jury Prize - Sundance 2003) before concentrating on television production. Scarlata has mainly focused on feature screenplays. The film is being produced by Travis Stevens of Snowfort Pictures (A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE), executive produced by Donald Rosenfeld, who has Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE in competition at the festival and co-produced with Michel Seydoux of Camera One, who have Alain Cavalier's PATER screening in competition.

Stevens in announcing the production said: ""This is a rare, intimate look at the creative process of one of history's most mind-blowing filmmakers. The access he afforded us was incredible. We're excited to be partnered with Camera-One and Koch Media in order to share it with the world.""

Moritz Peters of Koch Media adds: ""Fans of Jodorowsky, Giger, O'Bannon and the rest of the artists will now have a chance to see how they approach their work. We're avid supporters of adventurous sci-fi films, and happy to be co-producing one that covers such a fantastic subject.""

With interviews completed with Alejandro Jodorowsky, H.R. Giger, Chris Foss, Michel Seydoux, and the surviving original team, the production heads to the U.S. to conduct interviews with industry executives, filmmakers and film critics to put the film into perspective.

Adds Pavich, ""I am incredibly grateful that we are the ones who are getting to tell the story of this never-realized film from one of the world's greatest film directors. We hope to be able to impart to the audience a taste of what Jodorowsky's version of Dune might have been like.""

tYySF1M-vfk,Heldorado (1946) UNCUT Version Pt 1/1 ROY ROGERS & DALE EVANS,"For tmpt13. :o)  This is the complete, UNCUT version of the film!

State Ranger Roy Rogers helps his friend, Gabby, with the annual Heldorado Days Celebration, as well as investigating a counterfeit gang for the FBI. Gabby selects heiress Carol Randall to be Queen of the celebration, and appoints her a Deputy Sherriff. Roy is almost certain that society playboy, Alec Baxter, is distributing the fake bills through the gambling tables at the casino. Carol gets in the way constantly and Roy has to spend half of his time keeping her from spilling the beans to gang leader Mr. Driscoll. His investigation soon becomes a murder hunt with Ranger Rogers, Deputy Sherriff Dale, Manager Gabby, and The Sons of the Pioneers leading the chase!

This is the complete, 70 minute version of this film. Personally, I think this is one of Roy and Dale's best. It has plot, music, western excitement and really showcases Roy and Dale's talent. Dale's comedy is tops and she really shines as heiress Carol Randalll who is made an honorary Deputy Sherriff  (which she takes full advantage of!)! She even gets to participate in the final showdown!

Yagdzfx2PRI,Strip Search -- Inspeção Geral (Legendado),"EUA, 2004.

Direção de Sidney Lumet.

Sinopse -- em vez dela, leia trecho da resenha de Rubens Ewald Filho:

O filme é extremamente corajoso e contundente, atacando, já em 2004, época de eleições, o fim dos direitos dos cidadãos americanos, com a desculpa de que se tratava da caça aos terroristas.

Um prólogo com Austin Pendleton representando um professor procura deixar claro o risco: você deixaria de lado suas liberdades civis por um dia, um mês ou um ano? Mas e por dez anos? É o que fez o governo Bush com o consentimento tácito da nação, o que fica obviamente ilustrado por duas histórias paralelas, dois interrogatórios absolutamente iguais, só que um feito na China - um homem interroga uma mulher americana - e outro por uma mulher nos EUA interrogando um descendente de árabes.

Ambos com a cumplicidade dos governos que deveriam protegê-los, ambos sem provas reais. 

Para ser visto em escolas, discutido, polemizado.

TowiviD3xgE,BIRTH OF THE LIVING DEAD - Official Trailer,"In 1968 a young college drop-out named George A. Romero directed ""Night of the Living Dead,"" a low budget horror film that shocked the world, became an icon of the counterculture, and spawned a zombie industry worth billions of dollars that continues to this day.

""Birth of the Living Dead,"" a new documentary, shows how Romero gathered an unlikely team of Pittsburghers — policemen, iron workers, teachers, ad-men, housewives and a roller-rink owner — to shoot, with a revolutionary guerrilla, run-and-gun style, his seminal film. During that process Romero and his team created an entirely new and horribly chilling monster -- one that was undead and feasted upon human flesh.

This new documentary also immerses audiences into the singular time in which ""Night"" was shot.  Archival footage of the horrors of Vietnam and racial violence at home combined with iconic music from the 60s invites viewers to experience how Romero's tumultuous film reflected this period in American history.  ""Birth of the Living Dead"" shows us how this young filmmaker created a world-renowned horror film that was also a profound insight into how our society really works.",17732,69,5,123,0,-0.1122

The Two Faces of January Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst Movie HD

Screenwriter Hossein Amini (The Wings of the Dove, Drive) makes a stylish directing debut with this sleek thriller set in Greece and Istanbul, 1962, and adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel. Intrigue begins at the Parthenon when wealthy American tourists Chester MacFarland (Viggo Mortensen) and his young wife Collete (Kirsten Dunst) meet American expat Rydal (Oscar Isaac), a scammer working as a tour guide. Instead of becoming his latest marks, the two befriend him, but a murder at the couple's hotel puts all three on the run together and creates a precarious bond between them as the trio's allegiance is put to the test.

The legendary filmmaker was born in 1929 in Tocopilla, a coastal town on the edge of the Chilean desert, where this film was shot. It was there that Jodorowsky underwent an unhappy and alienated childhood as part of an uprooted family.
 
Blending his personal history with metaphor, mythology and poetry, The Dance of Reality reflects Jodorowsky's philosophy that reality is not objective but rather a ""dance"" created by our own imaginations.

In theaters June 6th.

Oscar® nominee Tom Cruise (the ""Mission: Impossible"" films, ""Collateral,"" ""Jerry Maguire"") and Emily Blunt (""The Devil Wears Prada,"" ""The Adjustment Bureau"") star in Warner Bros. Pictures' and Village Roadshow Pictures' sci-fi thriller ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" under the direction of Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"").

The epic action of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" unfolds in a near future in which an alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world.  

Major William Cage (Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission.  Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop—forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again.

But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt).  And, as Cage and Rita take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy.",7911902,24715,2814,155,0,0.202397

Claude and Marie Verneuil, from the provincial, Catholic upper middle class, are rather conservative parents. But they've always forced themselves to be open-minded.
 However, their tolerance has been sorely tested when their first daughter married a Muslim, the second a Jew, and the third a Chinese man. Their hopes to at last see one of their daughters married in church hence focus on their youngest, who has, halleluiah, just met a good Catholic...

iuqS_5-tUKA,AN UNREAL DREAM: THE MICHAEL MORTON STORY - Official Trailer,"For more information visit: www.firstrunfeatures.com/unrealdreamdvd

In 1986 Michael Morton's wife Christine is brutally murdered in front of their only child, and Michael is convicted of the crime.  Locked away in Texas prisons for a quarter century, estranged from his son, he has years to ponder questions of justice and innocence, truth and fate.  Though he is virtually invisible to society, the Innocence Project and Michael's pro bono attorney spend years fighting for the right to test DNA evidence found at the murder scene.  Their discoveries ultimately reveal that the price of a wrongful conviction goes well beyond one man's loss of freedom.

Director Al Reinert is a two-time Academy Award nominee, as a documentary filmmaker (For All Mankind, which won the documentary Jury and Audience Awards when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1989) and as a screenwriter (Apollo 13).

AUDIENCE AWARD WINNER, DOCUMENTARY SPOTLIGHT- SXSW 2013

""A powerful story of pain, injustice, redemption, and reconciliation."" - Huffington Post

""Recounts an outrageous miscarriage of justice without a trace of manufactured melodrama or visual hyperbole.  The film's rivetingly straightforward style of storytelling is a perfect match for its subject. An inspiring tale of spiritual uplift, sympathetically detailing how religious faith gave Morton the strength to endure, and the mercy to forgive."" - Variety

""An unflinching look at how Morton was wrongfully convicted of murder and had his only son disown him.""- Associated Press

""Makes very real an innocent man's nightmare through a cruel and broken justice system that stole his freedom, his relationship with his son and, nearly, his spirit.""- Houston Chronicle

""A gripping saga.  What is most frightening is how much effort and time it took a squad of highly motivated, expert lawyers to claw Morton out of prison, even after the truth became widely apparent. If a respected, responsible citizen like Morton can be thrown in prison for decades based on such a feeble case, the film asks, who among the rest of us can consider ourselves safe?""- PopMatters

""An extraordinary film...ultimately a story of transcendence.""- Austin American Statesman

""Morton's character fills this all-too-familiar story of injustice and absolution with a uniquely generous, moving spirit.""- Austin Chronicle",12771,45,8,143,0,-0.28274

LUGc568DMFs,Original Theatrical Trailer | Battle Circus | Warner Archive,"Battle Circus (1953) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #BattleCircus

Long before M*A*S*H, there was Battle Circus. Made during the Korean War, this tribute to the indomitable human spirit takes an authentic, almost documentary-like look at the nurses and doctors who operated in the battlefront Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. Major Jed Webbe (Humphrey Bogart) is a brilliant, hard-bitten Army surgeon with a weakness for women and strong liquor. Fresh from the states arrives Lt. Ruth McCara (June Allyson), a naïve young nurse ready to save the world. The story of their love and heroism, told against the grimly realistic background of pounding artillery and deadly ambushes, forms the core of the film.

The title Battle Circus comes from the way the mobile field units can strike their tents, move to a new battle area, then set them up again like circus roustabouts in nothing flat. And, like circus daredevils, these heroes risk life and death on a daily basis.

Directed By Richard Brooks
Starring Humphrey Bogart, June Allyson, Keenan Wynn

""Black Coffee"" is a story about Robert (Darrin Henson) who believes his world is crushed after he's fired from a company that his father built from the ground up. But, oftentimes, people come into your life and plant the seed of purpose and this is what Robert found in Morgan (Gabrielle Dennis).

But, Morgan's ex husband: Hill (Lamman Rucker) Robert's girlfriend Mita (Erica Hubbard) are both still in the picture which could mean it wasn't the right timing for Robert and Morgan to be be romantically linked.

Julian (Christian Keyes) the comedic relief in the film attempts to help Robert make the most logical decision, but, know that sometimes people come into your life for particular reason and with Morgan it was probably to encourage Robert to jump out on faith, find his purpose in life and start building his own business.

From her childhood bedroom in the Chicago suburbs, an American teenage girl uses social media to coordinate the revolution in Syria. Armed with Facebook, Twitter, Skype and camera phones, she helps her social network “on the ground” in Syria to show the world the human rights atrocities of a dictator. But just because the world can see the violence doesn’t mean the world can help. As the revolution rages on, everyone in the network must decide what is the most effective way to fight a dictator: social media or AK-47s.

-TLfrl_NqOw,Liv & Ingmar - A Love Story - OFFICIAL TRAILER - DOCUMENTARY 2012,"Liv & Ingmar - A Love Story

PAINFULLY CONNECTED. 

This film is a love story - covering the 42-year and 12-film relationship between legendary actress Liv Ullmann and master filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. 

This documentary is a homage - an affectionate but truthful account of two intertwined lives that experienced the full spectrum of emotions together, survived through extraordinary times, and left us with enduring creations as proof of the passion of their relationship both on and off-screen. 

Told entirely from Liv Ullmann's point of view through an interview, this biopic of an extraordinary relationship is constructed as a collage of images and sounds from the timeless Ullmann-Bergman films, behind-the-scenes footage, still photographs, passages from Liv's book 'Changing' and Ingmar's personal letters to Liv.

Ultimately this film is a candid look, not only at two of the greatest artists of our time, but also at two human beings, friends and soul mates.",67747,423,10,156,0,0.040149999999999984

When Sappho (Pola Negri) betrays her lover Andreas in favor of his boss George, Andreas goes insane over the rejection.

After Richard boards a train, Andreas murders a guard and escapes the asylum. Sappho learns of Richard's impending nuptials and haughtily sets out to trap another hapless lover at a society ball. Richard chases Sappho up the stairs, and the two embrace after hasty explanations. Andreas and George, who has also killed to see Sappho, watch with rage as the two lovers stand before them. Sappho pushes Richard out of the room and is left to the mercy of the two madmen in this tragic romantic drama",18712,197,13,60,0,0.24095

http://www.BettiePageRevealsAll.com

Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Mark Mori's BETTIE PAGE REVEALS ALL is an intimate look at one of the world's most recognized sex symbols, told in her own words for the first time.  

In Mori's alluring documentary, the real Bettie Page emerges from the veil of myth and rumor via audio interviews taped a decade prior to her death in 2008.  With earthy, razor sharp wit, Bettie tells her life story -- from humble beginnings as one of six children in an impoverished southern family, to high school salutatorian, to scandalous 50s pin-up model, to shocking retirement in 1957 at the peak of her modeling career.  Sharing rare details about her short-lived first marriage and many torrid affairs, this keen insider's glimpse follows Bettie through decades of broken marriages, born-again Christianity, and bouts of mental illness, before her ultimate return to the public eye in the early 90's, unaware of her cult status.  Ranked by Forbes in 2012 as one of the top ten posthumous celebrity earners, Bettie and her enduring legacy continue to flourish.

With a stunning array of gorgeous photographs, unusual archival material, and playful movie footage, BETTIE PAGE REVEALS ALL shows how Bettie's unabashed sexual expression and provocative poses set the stage for the sexual revolution and ushered in a modern era in fashion.  For stars like Katy Perry and Beyonce, as well as new generations of adoring fans around the world, Bettie remains an irresistible style icon and an empowering role model.",50060,104,6,138,0,0.4603333333333333

★ Best Thrillers are HERE ➨ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPEB6023EFC0BE77C9

When a mysterious cyber-attack cripples civilization, a group of old college friends and lovers retreat to a remote country home, where they must cope with an uncertain future while navigating the minefield of their shared past.

James and Lily live off the grid, raising their young daughter in a cocoon of comfort and sustainability. When a mysterious mass text ripples its way across the country, triggering a crippling, apocalyptic cyber attack, their home transitions from sheltered modern oasis to a fortress for the estranged old friends that show up at their door for protection and community. The unexpected reunion--abundant with revelry and remembrances, generously enhanced by organic wine and weed--is quickly undermined by the slights of the past, the spark of lingering flirtations and the threat of a locally grown new world order.

Balancing tense confrontations with slivers of levity, director Denis Henry Hennelly pinpoints a future where ideology explodes into action in every area

YcZ2ANo2ICI,The Trials of Cate McCall Official UK Trailer,"Out on UK VOD on 7th July 2014, courtesy of Solo Media.

The truth is on trial. Everyone is a witness.

Cate McCall (Kate Beckinsale; Pearl Harbour, Underworld, Total Recall), was a hotshot lawyer with the world at her feet, but as her career went from strength to strength, her personal life began to fall apart, she slipped into a spiral of alcoholism and depression that drove her family away, and left her with nothing. 

Sometimes we find redemption in the darkest of places and fresh out of rehab Cate must take on the appeal of a woman wrongfully convicted of murder in order to be reinstated at the bar and regain custody of her daughter.   But this is a case that will challenge everything she vowed to uphold; Cate will be thrown into a world of lies, abuse and deception, where fighting for what's right may mean fighting for her life.

The Trials of Cate McCall is an intelligent and tense thriller with powerful supporting performances from Nick Nolte (Gangster Squad, Warrior, Cape Fear, 48 Hrs.), James Cromwell (The Green Mile, The Artist, Spider-Man 3) and Anna Anishimowa (The Whistleblower).",99964,91,8,117,0,0.56345

The Corridor is a horror-thriller about male-bonding and miscommunication -- The Big Chill slammed into The Evil Dead.

Tyler Crawley needs his friends, now more than ever. Recovering from mental stress in the wake of his mom's death, Tyler has been counting on a weekend with the guys to bring him back to normal. For Tyler's sake his old buddies rally themselves, though the ""glue"" which keeps them together has weakened with the passing of recent years -- a natural enough occurrence.
 
But with the introduction of a single unnatural occurance -- the corridor itself -- the knots in these male bonds will come loose with a terrifying speed. Both a fantastical passageway to somewhere and a passageway into the mind of the male animal, the corridor will lead Tyler and his friends to the very edge of sanity and beyond...
 
""Keep an eye on Kelly and MacDonald, because The Corridor is one of the most impressive independent films of this year's Fantasia Festival: a masterful science-fiction/man-vs.-man thriller that also happens to one of the most emotionally resonant Canadian horror films I've seen in a long time. Grade: 3.5 Skulls out of 4.""
--Ariel Esteban Cayer, FANGORIA MAGAZINE
 
""The Corridor really cooks... cerebral, shocking, and consistently fun to discover. The actors are strong, the pacing is tight, and the scary bits arrive as either basic, bloody, or borderline brilliant... and the result is one of the coolest Canadian chillers in years.""
--Scott Weinberg,, FEARnet.com, Cinematical
 
""A gripping work from start to finish, [and] a delightfully unnerving mind-fuck... [The Corridor] is a fabulously effective feature debut for Kelly, and a work that bodes well for all of the talent involved, both on screen and behind the camera. Grade: A-.""
--Brent Simon, President, Los Angeles Film Critics' Association
 
""...A collection of The Big Chill, Dreamcatcher & The Treasure of the Sierra Madre... Strong acting, natural dialogue and a foreboding tone make The Corridor an engaging psychological, sci-fi horror trip"".
--TwitchFilm.com

""Be proud, Canada, be proud. There's a genre-film storm brewing in Halifax. An ingenious spin on 'cabin in the woods' horror narratives, THE CORRIDOR plays like an... hallucinatory THE BIG CHILL with mass murder. Kelly's film is a marvel that frequently surprises with twists and turns... Smart, tight and shocking, THE CORRIDOR is one hell of a breakout.""

This film is amazing. I watched it and fell in love -- it's the same person who made Simple Simon which is also available on my channel with English subs. ENJOY!

* ""We in 5th grade"" is a Swedish show about 5th graders who compete in a quiz on TV and radio. All Sweden's 5th graders can apply through their school -- it's really popular. 

SUMMARY:
Bitch Hug is the story about Kristin who is sick of her life living in a Swedish small town. She's written a list of 1000 things she wants to do before she dies. On top of that list is going to New York. Now that she's graduating she's going there and she gets a chance to write about for the small town's newspaper. All her dreams are about come true -- if only she can stay awake on the night of her graduation since the plane leaves early in the morning. 
While partying she decides to follow some random guy home and when she explores the huge house she meets the sister -- a younger girl named Andrea. They hang out but end up falling asleep and Kristin misses her flight. While she waits for the airport to call if another ticket gets available she decides to hide with Andrea and her two brothers in the big house out in the middle of nowhere. She pretends to write about the city that never sleeps while trying to fool the world that she's really there. Meanwhile she uncovers truths about Andrea and she realizes that one person can change you completely.",13339,25,4,569,0,0.95325

The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz Official Trailer #1 directed by Brian Knappenberger and starring Tim Berners-Lee, Cory Doctorow, Peter Eckersley.

The story of programming prodigy and information activist Aaron Swartz. From Swartz's help in the development of the basic internet protocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit, his fingerprints are all over the internet. But it was Swartz's groundbreaking work in social justice and political organizing combined with his aggressive approach to information access that ensnared him in a two year legal nightmare. It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron's story touched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was a celebrity. This film is a personal story about what we lose when we are tone deaf about technology and its relationship to our civil liberties.

A gripping Polish Cold War thriller based on the incredible true story of a chief military planner who spied for the CIA.

Polish Colonel Ryszard Kuklinski (Marcin Dorocinski) is one of the senior officers planning manoeuvres of Warsaw Pact troops. His operations include the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia to crush the liberal reforms of the Prague Spring. But Kuklinski begins to fear the ultimate annihilation of Poland in a US nuclear counterattack against the Soviets. So he makes contact with the CIA, who give him the code name Jack Strong. Kuklinski then begins to pass on thousands of secret documents, at enormous risk to himself and his family. Writer/director Wladyslaw Pasikowski's extraordinary thriller is based on meticulous research, partly conducted in cooperation with the CIA. Some crucial documents kept in the Institute of National Remembrance were also declassified for the project. High-profile consultants include Kuklinski's CIA contacts officer David Forden and President Carter's National Security Adviser.

SOM DU SER MEG - på kino fra 14. september!

En sykepleier havner i en arbeidskonflikt fordi hun slår om til engelsk når hun blir usikker. En oversetter setter sin integritet på spill i det hun overtales til å oversette en bok hun ikke kan stå inne for.

SOM DU SER MEG er en varm og nyansert film om mennesker som alle vil godt, men ender opp med å såre hverandre. Om hvordan mennesker som handler ut fra integritet og følelser oppfattes som vanskelige i et samfunn der idealet er at man skal oppføre seg rasjonelt.

Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Documentary HD


What does it mean to be a performing artist - first, last and always? Broadway legend Elaine Stritch can answer that. At 87, Stritch is still here, dominating the stage in her one woman cabaret act, torturing Alec Baldwin on 30ROCK, giving us her take on aging, her struggle with alcohol and diabetes, and the fear of leaving the follow spot behind. In stolen moments from her corner room at the Carlyle, and on breaks from her tour and work, candid reflections about her life are punctuated with rare archival footage, words from friends (Hal Prince, George C. Wolfe, Nathan Lane, Cherry Jones and John Turturro) and photographs from her personal collection. By turns bold, hilarious and achingly poignant, the journey connects Stritch's present to her past, and an inspiring portrait of a one-of-a-kind survivor emerges.",140318,669,27,137,0,0.2637291666666667

Led by an all-star comedy cast of colorful and quirky employees, this film promises to keep viewers rolling in the aisles as they watch the downfall of a movie studio that is willing to do anything to make a buck, even if it means ruining its reputation, and running the entire movie industry into the ground.  When Sunshine Studios is faced with making a hit or closing its doors, the company puts everything on the line to make the biggest parody film of all time.  With no script, no name, and no idea what they're doing, they set out to make  -  Not Another Not Another Movie.

Following in the footsteps of highly successful audience favorite mockumentaries like: Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and The Office...  Not Another Not Another Movie is the first of its kind to lampoon the parody industry.  In this hilarious, non-stop ride, we follow Sunshine Studios, the absolute worst film company on the planet; a studio that produces such wonderful films as Vampires in Mexico 2, Attack of the Bulldozer, and Titanic 2: The Ghost Story.

Let The Fire Burn Official Trailer 1 (2013) - Documentary HD


On May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police dropped two pounds of military explosives onto a city row house occupied by the radical group MOVE. The resulting fire was not fought for over an hour although firefighters were on the scene with water cannons in place. Five children and six adults were killed and sixty-one homes were destroyed by the six-alarm blaze, one of the largest in the city's history. This dramatic tragedy unfolds through an extraordinary visual record previously withheld from the public. It is a graphic illustration of how prejudice, intolerance and fear can lead to unthinkable acts of violence.",143240,786,62,143,0,0.011903030303030294

A brilliant doctor vows revenge on a crazy sadistic killer following the murder of his wife… and devises the perfect assassination plan by turning a young woman into the most lethal assassin the world has ever seen. This outrageous plan will unfold in the killer's heavily fortified underground lair. The lethal assassin will be placed into a temporal state and sent into the facility as a dead body… but when she wakes, it is everyone else in the compound who will be deprived of their lives.

But there is one catch. What will she use as a weapon? The staff of the underground facility is armed with weapons that have fingerprint authentication systems so it's impossible for her to use their weapons. The doctor's genius plan is to surgically hide the gun parts into the woman's body, so she can rip off her stitches when she wakes, take out the parts, assemble the gun and become the ultimate Gun Woman.

From director Kurando Mitsutake, who dazed genre fans with his ""Samurai Avenger: The Blind Wolf"" comes an original kick-ass film, Gun Woman, starring rising Japanese action star Asami (The Machine Girl, Dead Sushi). Watch crazy meet crazier in this no-holds-barred revenge flick!

IFMljEksTIs,Ju-on: The Beginning of the End (Ju-on: owari no hajimari) theatrical trailer,"Description from the Fantasia International Film Festival: ""Young teacher Yui Ikuno is offered a substitute position following the sudden departure of a third-grade teacher. If the opportunity fills her with happiness, her student Toshio's repeated absenteeism quickly taints the experience. Her calls to the young student's home remain unanswered, and Yui goes there in person to enquire about his condition. Toshio's mother, Kayoko, reacts strangely, to say the least, and a child's voice convinces the teacher to go look at the kid's bedroom, which she finds, much to her surprise, condemned. Following this visit, worrying phenomena starts happening around Yui. Turns out Kayoko and Toshio's house is home to sordid secrets and all that dare enter it fall victim to the curse that haunts it. ¶ Such a rumour proves attractive to young schoolgirls looking for a thrill. Aoi hears from her older sister that the house she is trying to sell might be haunted, so she brings three of her friends to visit - and get a little scared. Amongst the group, Nanami is the most reticent to enter, but her friends ridicule her into following them. It is a poor decision, as her future, as well her friends', becomes seriously compromised... ¶ Fans of classic J-Horror, rejoice! The curse of Kayoko and Toshio is back! This new entry in the JU-ON series offers a fresh starting point, much like SADAKO 3D. Unlike that reinterpretation of the RINGU trilogy, however, JU-ON: THE BEGINNING OF THE END closely follows the narrative structure of its predecessors and through this, speaks directly to fans of the series and to our greatest enjoyment! The director and co-writer Masayuki Ochiai (HYPNOSIS) brings us back to the haunted house and reinstates, slowly but surely, its oppressive atmosphere through a refined and efficient use of mise-en-scene. On screenwriting duties, he is aided by Taka Ichise, a specialist in Japanese horror whose wealth of credits as a producer ranges from classics like RINGU and JU-ON: THE GRUDGE to lesser-known gems such as NOROI. Everything is in place for the comeback of one of contemporary horror cinema's most beloved franchises, plunging into terror anyone brave enough to confront the wrath of Kayoko and Toshio!""",262110,422,99,90,0,0.011056862745098041

2MhDWzqjlkM,THE LAST TABOO OFFICIAL TRAILER,"Let's face it, s**t is disgusting. And food and water contaminated with s**t kills one child worldwide every 20 seconds - more than AIDS and Malaria combined.

But THE LAST TABOO is not a worthy documentary with a righteous message. Instead it uses humour and sincerity to tell the stories of two remarkable Kenyan men who are helping their local communities to stop defecating in the open and start building toilets.

And that's a tall order when over 60% of all Kenyans use the bush rather than the bathroom, in thrall to all sorts of taboos and cultural barriers.

In Ganze village,the charismatic Chief Charro takes his villagers through a remarkable 'triggering' process, collecting fresh feces and shocking his community into change. And in the slums of Nairobi Mambo Dennis makes s**t his business, bringing people together to demand change and more latrines.

Unflinchingly and with affection, THE LAST TABOO shines a light on an unsolved public health crisis to inspire the audience to believe in people power and the possibilities for change.",4198,6,1,149,0,-0.1335

David Reimer (birth name: Bruce Reimer, born: August 22, 1965 -- died [suicide]: May 4, 2004) was born as a healthy male, but was sexually reassigned and raised as female after his penis was accidentally destroyed during circumcision. Psychologist John Money oversaw the case and reported the reassignment as successful, and as evidence that gender identity is primarily learned. Academic sexologist Milton Diamond later reported that Reimer never identified as female, and that he began living as male at age 15. Reimer later went public with his story to discourage similar medical practices. Eventually he committed suicide, due to suffering years of severe depression, financial instability and a dissolving marriage.

loBAqleP-Ys,EMR Trailer,"Erskine and McCulloughs debut feature is a deft thriller that cleverly weaves together a host of urban myths, from kidney-stealing and alien abduction, to manipulative drug corporations; this is a paranoiacs wonderland. Reminiscent of Jacobs Ladder and with shades of Donnie Darko, the plot winds its way, Rubiks cube-like, to a satisfyingly twisted climax.
At times sinister, surprising and striking, and with an endearingly hapless hero, EMR is a refreshingly British take on the thriller that will make you think twice the next time you knock back a couple of aspirin.

Synopsis:
When they ran to save their lives for the first time, they were mere 12-year-old boys, and the world called them 'refugees'.

The war of 1971 gave birth to a new country - Bangladesh. It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram and Bala. They witnessed the war and its aftermath, where the world tried to trample over them. Fighting for survival, they clung to each other and escaped to Calcutta.

Before they knew the world, they knew each other. Such was their bond, such was their friendship.

Each time they sought new beginnings, each time they would rise, the world would crush them down. So, they fought again... and again. Together they were unbeatable. They were unstoppable. They were inseparable.

In the years that passed, Bikram and Bala, became Calcutta's most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless and most powerful GUNDAY!

They had everything... then, one fine day, bells rang...

Nandita, the most beautiful cabaret dancer, walked into their lives, and they lost everything to her. Their murky world turned magical and colourful. They fell head over heels in love with her.

But that was only a blissful lull before an impending storm...

And then entered ACP Satyajeet Sarkar, the right for every wrong, a law for every outlaw and a counter force for Bikram and Bala.

What follows from here is the most sensational-most thrilling-most dramatic story ever told!

A Most Wanted Man Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Philip Seymour Hoffman, Willem Dafoe Thriller HD

Anton Corbijn's adaptation of John Le Carre's psychological novel follows German spy Gunther Bachmann as he tracks down Issa, a suspicious Chechen-Russian immigrant on the run in Hamburg. Pressured by his German and American colleagues to capture and interrogate his suspect as a Muslim terrorist, Bachmann instead asks for more time to carefully track Issa's movements and his relationship with his German immigration lawyer, Annabel Richter. Using his secret contacts and keen skill, Bachmann uncovers a connection between a world-renowned Muslim philanthropist and a terrorist group and devises a plan to use Issa and Annabel in a brilliant ploy to expose the scheme.

Molly Maxwell Official Trailer 1 (2013) - Lola Tash, Charlie Carrick Drama HD

At Phoenix Progressive School, where everyone tries to outdo each other with creative self-expression, 16-year-old Molly Maxwell would rather be invisible than risk revealing herself as completely ordinary. When her young, handsome, disillusioned English teacher enters the picture and allows her to just be herself, Molly is suddenly able to flourish. As their student-teacher bond becomes more intimate, she begins putting herself on the line in unexpected ways while pursuing what she wants. But with each awkward, beautiful step towards an impossible romance, Molly risks alienating everyone she loves.

Kidnapped For Christ Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Documentary HD

On Thursday, July 10th at 7:30pm ET/PT, SHOWTIME will premiere KIDNAPPED FOR CHRIST, a powerful, award-winning documentary that chronicles the shocking truth behind Escuela Caribe, a controversial Christian behavior modification program in the Dominican Republic for ""troubled"" U.S. teenagers.  Initially hoping to document the positive effects a boarding school like this could have on struggling youth, evangelical filmmaker Kate Logan is granted unprecedented access and allowed to live on campus for the summer.  Once there, Logan's eyes are opened to the truth beneath the sunny façade of this remote reform school—kids being taken by force in the middle of the night, rumors of physical abuse, and staff imposing arbitrary and degrading punishments on the young students—and encounters students who change her life.
 
In the 85-minute documentary, Logan meets David, a 17-year-old honor student from Colorado, sent to the program shortly after coming out to his parents; Beth, a 15-year-old from Michigan suffering from debilitating panic attacks; and Tai, a 16-year-old Haitian-American girl from Boston experimenting with drugs to cope with childhood trauma.  With mounting evidence that this so-called ""therapeutic boarding school"" is no more than a crude brainwashing camp, Logan is determined to help at least one student escape.  The struggles she faces to secure the child's freedom reveal just how far Escuela Caribe will go to prevent their students from leaving, becoming a journey that tests Logan's faith in ways she could never imagine.
 
Special Jury Award Winner of the 2014 Nashville Film Festival and the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at 2014 Slamdance Film Festival, KIDNAPPED FOR CHRIST is executive produced by Lance Bass, Mike C. Manning and Tom DeSanto.  KIDNAPPED FOR CHRIST is presented by REDTHORN, in association with LOOK CLOSER MEDIA.",240409,1732,816,126,0,-0.186282

In winter as the snow begins to fall, the hotel turns into a shelter but also an inescapable place that fuels their animosities...",78933,101,1,97,0,0.5927
UWEDF4FdgxQ,"""What, No Beer?!"" Durante and Keaton in their heyday, 1933","Most Hollywood historians don't realize that these 2 comedy titans were a team for a short while in the early 30's. 
The Great Jimmy Durante was at the apex of his Broadway musical career when he was seduced by the big studios to get into ""The Pictures"". 
Buster Keaton was nearing the nadir of his groundbreaking tenure as one of the few giants of the Silent Film Era to actually give Charlie Chaplin a run for his money. His brilliant physical comedy career was actually hurt a bit by the advent of the ""talkies""...(I personally love his voice; as you can hear in this clip, he had a deep, meloncholy vocal tone with a midwestern drawl that made him quite endearing.)

Both men were rather short, and Durante, who was about an inch taller, often squated and slouched so he could look up to his partners, including the shorter Keaton. 

One can speculate why their comedy pairing didn't last. I think it's a marvelous pairing of 2 of the most disctinctive personalities in the history of Show Business!  Their contrasting energy levels exude robust chemistry and delight us with their timeless interaction.

Jimmy, the raspy voiced bundle of chaotic energy who's always trying to get things done, and Buster, the shy, pensive nebbish who longs for love... It works! 

And just look at that peripheral detail from the 1930's!   This timely slice of Americana occured just after the voting out of the age of Prohibition, which forbade the legal sale of alcohol in the US for over 10 years.    
You can feel the crackling spirit of ""Happy Days are Here Again"" as America was once again a Beer swiling Nation. 
After all, that's what we do best in this country;  Celebrate, right?!

And who better to have a few beers with than the Sultan of Sadness and The Earl of Ebullience!

BIFF (2014) - In Order Of Disappearance Norwegian Trailer - Action Movie HD

Check out the 2014 Berlin International Film Festival Playlist: http://goo.gl/p2oMG0


Norway, winter. Introverted and hard-working Nils drives the powerful snow plough that keeps open the roads and mountain passes of the inhospitable frozen landscape where he lives. He's just been named citizen of the year for his efforts when he receives news that his son has died of a heroin overdose. Refusing to believe the official version of his son's death, he begins a covert search for the boy's alleged murderers. A surprising turn of events causes him to become a tough-as-nails and feared underworld hero -- one whose identity nobody knows. A gruesome black comedy full of impressive images of an endless wintry-white landscape which Nils knows how to use to his advantage. The film deploys dark comedy to depict Nils' exploits in the realm of gangsters, which is characterised by a delicately nuanced portrayal of the mentalities of Swedish, Norwegian and Serb mafiosi with Bruno Ganz putting in an appearance as a Serb mafia boss. In Order of Disappearence reunites the creative team of director Hans Petter Moland, screenwriter Kim Pupz Aakeson and actor Stellan Skarsgård.",42660,52,3,131,0,0.0

_JvyZtNA4CU,American Revolutionary: the Evolution of Grace Lee Boggs Trailer,"The Pacific Arts Movement Presents: 
The 14th Annual San Diego Asian Film Festival 2013 (November 7-16)

AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY: THE EVOLUTION OF GRACE LEE BOGGS

Audience Award, 2013 Los Angeles Film Festival

We would all be so lucky to know a Grace Lee Boggs: activist, feminist, author, speaker, and philosopher. As of this writing she is still socially active at age 97. Grandmotherly in appearance but fierce and outspoken -- sometimes to the point of making people cry during arguments -- she embodies the spirit of the words she once spoke: ""You don't choose the times you live in, but you do choose who you want to be.""

In her previous The Grace Lee Project (SDAFF '05), filmmaker Grace Lee (no relation to Boggs) created diverse portraits of people who share her name. Grace Lee Boggs though, warranted a film all of her own. The Chinese American Boggs has long been an advocate for the rights of African Americans, who have in turn embraced her and her husband, auto worker and fellow activist James Boggs.

Shot over a decade in Boggs' home city of Detroit, AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY offers a reverential but also critical overview of her ideas and accomplishments, deeply influenced by Marx and Hegel. It also takes a sobering, though optimistic, look at the city's history. Able to adapt her methods and ideas to a changing environment, Grace Lee Boggs has become a symbol of sustainable activism. --Wilda Wong

SV4ptfyaQFA,ZERO MOTIVATION - official US trailer,"WINNER - BEST NARRATIVE FEATURE - TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL

""Filmmaker Talya Lavie steps into the spotlight with Zero Motivation, a zany, dark comedic portrait of everyday life for a unit of young, female Israeli soldiers. The human resources office at a remote desert base serves as the setting for this cast of characters who bide their time pushing paper and battling in computer games, counting down the minutes until they can return to civilian life. Amidst their boredom and clashing personalities, issues of commitment—to friendship, love, and country—are handled with humor and sharp-edged wit. A decorated veteran herself (of film) with time spent at Sundance Labs, Berlinale, and MoMA, Lavie combats the status quo by flipping genre on its head and bending gender roles to a delightful extreme.""
–Tribeca Film Festival

ZERO MOTIVATION will open at Film Forum in New York on December 3, 2014 with a national release to follow. For more information visit http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/zeromotivation",253309,601,50,123,0,0.16220689655172416
THVFkk-sEus,Jupiter Ascending - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"http://jupiterascending.com
https://www.facebook.com/jupiterascending
In theaters July 18, 2014.

Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis star in ""Jupiter Ascending,"" an original science fiction epic adventure from filmmakers Lana and Andy Wachowski.

Jupiter Jones (Kunis) was born under a night sky, with signs predicting that she was destined for great things.  Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning other people's houses and an endless run of bad breaks.  Only when Caine (Tatum), a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along—her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.

From the streets of Chicago to far flung galaxies whirling through space, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is written and directed by the Wachowskis.  Award-winning producer Grant Hill, with whom they have collaborated since ""The Matrix"" Trilogy, is producing, together with Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski.  Roberto Malerba and Bruce Berman serve as executive producers.",5148408,14815,1746,116,0,0.168569

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) fights his old friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) and his wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) for control of his Las Vegas empire.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The inner-workings of a corrupt Las Vegas casino are exposed in Martin Scorsese's story of crime and punishment. The film chronicles the lives and times of three characters: ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a bookmaking wizard; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime best friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in a role she was born to play), a leggy ex-prostitute with a fondness for jewelry and a penchant for playing the field. Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voiceover, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film's first hour and a half details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick apart their Camelot piece by piece.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a futuristic world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
An intense film about time travel, this sci-fi entry was directed by Terry Gilliam, a member of the comedy troupe Monty Python. The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle.

Mario (Oscar® nominee Massimo Troisi in his final screen performance) is a newly appointed mailman who is madly in love with the most beautiful woman in town, Beatrice Russo (Maria Grazia Cucinotta). Bumbling, interminably shy and far too nervous to tell her how he feels, Mario becomes inspired when a world-famous Chilean poet visits the small island community. Pablo Neruda (Award winning actor Philippe Noiret, Cinema Paradiso) is a revelation to the otherwise introverted and soft spoken Mario and with his expert help Mario not only finds the right words to woo Beatrice but has a fighting chance to win her over.",60199,151,6,114,0,0.49174999999999996

But like many of us, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) never could have predicted the course his own life would take, when he reluctantly accepts a job as a teacher. 

A musician and composer consumed with a love for music, Holland's true goal is to write one memorable piece of music to leave his mark on the world. But instead, he finds his calling in the most unlikely place, sharing his love of music with his students--to let it fill their lives, the way it fills his. His students respond to his contagious passion, and as the years unfold, Holland finds himself on an unplanned path. 

Redefining success and his own dreams, Holland realizes that his legacy will be greater than he ever dreamed. And with the help of his students and his family, Glenn Holland learns that though our lives don't always turn out the way we plan them, life is what happens when you embrace the unexpected.

Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) Official Trailer #1

""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking your Juice in the Hood"" is a parody of a lot of black U.S. movies, for instance ""Boyz n the Hood"", ""South Central"", ""Menace II Society"", ""Higher Learning"" and ""Juice"". We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. Crazy stuff happens. For example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.

KRrUiYxr5dc,Before and After (1996) Trailer,"How well do you know your child?  If they did something awful, how far would you go to protect them, not only from outside forces, but from themselves?  These are the intriguing questions that the gripping first act of Before and After sets up.  Unfortunately, with a muddled second act, the film loses sight of these questions and quickly sinks into overwrought territory that's marred by maudlin speeches and silly handwringing.

Wayne Wang's follow-up movie to Smoke presents a series of improvisational situations strung together to form a pastiche of Brooklyn's diverse ethnicity, offbeat humor, and essential humanity. Many of the same characters inhabiting Auggie Wren's Brooklyn Cigar Store in Smoke return here to expound on their philosophy of smoking, relationships, baseball, New York, and Belgian Waffles. Most of all, this is a movie about living life, off-the-cuff.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Taplow (Ben Silverstone) attempts to ask a favor of Mr. Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney), a spiteful headmaster on the verge of retirement.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Forty-three years after the first screen treatment of Terence Rattigan's play about a teacher facing the end of his career, Albert Finney takes on the role of Mr. Crocker-Harris, the Latin teacher forced into early retirement by a heart condition. After teaching in a public school for twenty years, Crocker-Harris is being put out to pasture in a less stressful job teaching English to foreigners. Meanwhile, his home life is also falling apart: his wife (Greta Scacchi) is having an affair with the American chemistry teacher (Matthew Modine), who nevertheless admires Crocker-Harris for his dignity and decency. Through it all, Crocker-Harris hides his pain behind his stiff British reserve.

"" Time never dies. The circle is never round. ""

The first film made in the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, Milcho Manchevski's Before the Rain crosscuts the stories of an orthodox Christian monk (Grégoire Colin), a British photo agent (Katrin Cartlidge), and a native Macedonian war photographer (Rade Šerbedžija) to paint a portrait of simmering ethnic and religious hatred about to reach its boiling point. Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema's most powerful laments on the futility of war.

The movie won more than 30 awards including Golden Lion in Venice and earned an Oscar nomination!

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A day in the lives of two convenience clerks as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
When Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is reluctantly put in charge of the Quick Stop market on his day off, he tries, though half-heartedly, to perform his minimum-wage duties as efficiently as possible. This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service. Much of the film consists of Randall and Dante's criticism of their customers, their lives, and the world in general. Clerks, filmed in black-and-white on a budget of only $27,000, began the career of writer director Kevin Smith, who would go on to make Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).

tZlr2PbTiow,Just Cause - Trailer,"Some mystery thrillers keep the mind racing. Some keep the heart hammering. Just Cause does both so powerfully it's ""the best thriller since The Silence of the Lambs"" (Susan Granger, CRN/American Movie Classics). Sean Connery, Laurence Fishburne, Ed Harris and more top talents ignite the fast-paced nerve-jangler that pumps the adrenaline full throttle and works the gray matter overtime. Connery plays Paul Armstrong, a Harvard Law School professor who reopens a murder investigation on behalf of a Death Row inmate (Blair Underwood) who claims he was forced by a sinister lawman (Fishburne) to confess to a crime he didn't commit. On the surface, it seems to be a straight-ahead case of the prisoner's guilt or innocence. But nothing really lies on the surface of this mystery set in the Florida swamplands. Expect the unexpected. And also expect ""a riveting, action-packed thriller! Brimming with suspense."" (Neil Rosen, NY-1 News/New York). MPAA Rating: R  (c) 1995 Warner Bros.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Hit men, gangsters and robbers converge in Quentin Tarantino's violent tale of revenge. Stars John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.

Order in the US: http://bit.ly/1QMlThx

Inspired by the paranoid visions of John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds, the desert noir of Detour and the black and white widescreen beauty of Hiroshi Teshigahara’s The Face of Another and Woman of the Dunes, Suture is one of great feature debuts – by writer-directors David Siegel and Scott McGehee – and a truly unique piece of cinema.

The wealthy and self-assured Vincent (Michael Harris) meets his blue collar half-brother Clay (Dennis Haysbert) at their father’s funeral and is struck by their similarity. He decides to murder Clay and take his identity, only Clay survives the assassination attempt with no memory and is mistaken for Vincent. The fact that Harris is white and Haysbert is black only complicates a film that probes into the nature of identity.

After viewing an early rough cut, Steven Soderbergh came on board as executive producer and enthusiastic patron. Suture went on to become a hit on the festival circuit, including Sundance where it deservedly won the award for Best Cinematography.

FILM SYNOPSIS
A spellbinding account of the career of the most renowned woman director, best known as Hitler's moviemaker and recently hailed by The New York Times as ""one of the greatest woman filmmakers ever."" In this remarkable documentary, Leni Riefenstahl addresses her past for the first time on camera.

Length: 3:01   Rating: NR

English and German with English Subtitles

List Price: $29.95 | Our Price: $22.00 

 
While she never actually joined the Nazi Party, as the creator of the single most effective propaganda film ever made, Triumph of the Will, Riefenstahl has spent much of her life trying to live down her association with the Third Reich. Her personal relationship with Hitler is still in question.

Feisty and charismatic at 91, Riefenstahl revisits the landmarks of her turbulent life -- from her beginnings as a daredevil actress in German ""mountain films"" to her direction of such stunning narratives as The Blue Light (1932) and Tiefland (1940s, released in 1954), to her infamous, brilliant documentaries Triumph of the Will (1935) and Olympia (1938), to her anthropological photographs of the now extinct Nuba tribes in Africa. The film brings the story of Riefenstahl right up to her current passion, scuba diving and shooting films of exotic aquatic life. All together, a riveting story that leaves the viewer in total awe of its controversial subject.

cl4B9AU45P4,Philadelphia (1993) - Movie Trailer,"With Hanks, who is always watchable, and Washington, who has also got a very good track record, this film was destined to be fantastic but not even I, who always has an optimistic view when it comes to movies, was ready for the impact that this film made. Tom Hanks excelled even himself with his performance as an AIDS striken homosexual who is fired from his job simply because of his condition. It is Hanks, by himself, who makes the whole scenario in the film believable. Although this is Hanks's best performance of his career, he is very closely followed by Denzel Washington who gives a perfect performance as the only lawyer who will take on the case although he is a homophobe himself. The emotional strain of the film on the audience is immense and in the later stages of the film it is almost impossible to watch because of that. The make-up which gives the impression that Hanks really does have the terrible disease is perfect and the simple yet striking direction from Jonathan Demme(The Silence Of The Lambs) make this utterly compelling viewing although at times it is very uncomfortable. All praise to everyone in the making of this beautiful film.

Cast: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Roberta Maxwell, Buzz Kilman, Karen Finley, Daniel Chapman, Mark Sorensen Jr., Jeffrey Williamson, Charles Glenn, Ron Vawter, Anna Deavere Smith, Stephanie Roth Haberle, Lisa Talerico, Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards.

The Piano (1993) Official Trailer - Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin Movie HD

Set in 1851, a mute Scottish woman arrives in colonial New Zealand for an arranged marriage, with her precocious young daughter and beloved piano in tow. Her practical new husband refuses to transport the piano to their home and makes a deal with his neighbor, George Baines to take the piano off his hands.

O6KCfmSKnD8,The Three Musketeers (1993) Recut (Action),"*NOTE: This is not the official trailer, I created this. This has been linked on many sites as ""representing the real movie,"" when it doesn't. I'm posting this message to let others who wish to embed this know that this isn't the real trailer. In fact, a few contradictions to the actual movie plot are played on. 

For those of you who are fans of ""The Three Musketeers"" (Chris O'Donnell; Kiefer Sutherland), I've created a recut trailer making the musketeers slightly more ""bad-ass"", who fight the king. Cardinal Richelieu tries to protect the king from the rogue musketeers, making him a good guy.

Note that this is my first non-horror/thriller recut, rather a redo trailer with a lot of twists to the old story. The action (I hope) will make up for the lack of the horror feel.

Also, I guarantee that there is no other trailer like this one for this movie anywhere. You might even feel like watching the real movie after viewing this. Of course, all credit would go to Disney and Caravan for producing this fun film. Enjoy!",125105,128,20,176,0,0.5763777777777778

F1os6UU6jhU,Terminator 2: Judgement Day - Official Movie Trailer,"A sequel to the sci-fi action thriller that made him and star Arnold Schwarzenegger A-list Hollywood names, writer/director James Cameron upped the ante with this follow-up by employing a more sweeping storyline and cutting-edge special effects. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor (Edward Furlong), during the late nineties. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about humankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps break Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two Terminators at a steel foundry. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which won four Oscars in technical categories for its groundbreaking effects, was followed by a short sequel filmed exclusively as an attraction for theme parks, Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time (1996). - Karl Williams, Rovi

J0obOvGGb1U,Dances With Wolves - Official® Trailer [HD],"Release Date: November 21, 1990

A historical drama about the relationship between a Civil War soldier and a band of Sioux Indians, Kevin Costner's directorial debut was also a surprisingly popular hit, considering its length, period setting, and often somber tone. The film opens on a particularly dark note, as melancholy Union lieutenant John W. Dunbar attempts to kill himself on a suicide mission, but instead becomes an unintentional hero.

His actions lead to his reassignment to a remote post in remote South Dakota, where he encounters the Sioux. Attracted by the natural simplicity of their lifestyle, he chooses to leave his former life behind to join them, taking on the name Dances with Wolves. Soon, Dances with Wolves has become a welcome member of the tribe and fallen in love with a white woman who has been raised amongst the tribe.

His peaceful existence is threatened, however, when Union soldiers arrive with designs on the Sioux land.

The film has won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Tom (David Schwimmer) freaks out when his high school crush, Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), shows up, and hassles Scott (Michael Vartan) for his shirt.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This dark comedy is a clever homage to classic generation gap comedies such as The Graduate (1967), The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Big Chill (1983), filtered through an ironic Generation X lens. Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is unemployed and aimless, hovering between childhood and adult responsibilities. A year out of college, Tom can't land a decent job -- he still lives with his mother in Brooklyn. He receives a call from Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), who informs Tom that her son Bill, Tom's best friend in high school, has killed himself. She wants Tom to deliver the eulogy and serve as a pallbearer, and flustered, Tom agrees, though he has no recollection of Bill. After delivering a lackluster eulogy, Tom meets the grieving Ruth and begins an impulsive affair with her. He also encounters Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful classmate for whom he's long carried a torch. Although Julie at first mistakes Tom for someone else, they begin dating, while he keeps his relationship with Ruth a secret. First-time writer-director Matt Reeves work-shopped the script for The Pallbearer with writing partner Jason Katims at the Sundance Institute. Reeves went on to create the TV series Felicity.

Dead Man (1995) Official Trailer - Johnny Depp Movie HD

Dead Man is the story of a young man's journey, both physically and spiritually, into very unfamiliar terrain. William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named ""Nobody,"" who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side.

Dean Stockwell, then just five years into a career stretching from the 1940s into the 21st century, plays the title role.

j8zg_25-SYA,Ashes Of Time Redux - Trailer,"Master Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai directed this lyrical, dream-like martial arts epic. A famously troubled shoot, the film took two years and 40 million dollars to produce (a shocking sum for a national cinema populated with low-budget quickies) and features a virtual who's who of the Hong Kong film world. Conceived as a prequel to the popular martial arts novel The Eagle-Shooting Hero by Jin Yong, the movie is less a straightforward action thriller than a visually striking meditation on memory and love. It nominally centers on Ouyang Feng (Leslie Cheung), who ekes out a lonely existence as an itinerant hired sword. Getting on in years and tormented by memories of a lost love, he also works an agent for other mercenary assassins from his remote desert abode. Ouyang's old friend and fellow swordsman, Huang Yaoshi (Tony Leung Kar-Fai, who starred in the The Lover) drowns his lovelorn misery in a magical wine that makes him forget. Later, a mysterious young man named Murong Yang (Brigitte Lin) hires Ouyang to kill his sister's unfaithful suitor, Huang Yaoshi. The following day, that spurned sister, Murong Yin (Lin again), hires Ouyang to protect her dearly beloved. Meanwhile, Hong Qi (pop star Jacky Cheung) finds some redemption for a life of killing by accepting a poor girl's offer to avenge her brother's death -- a task that Ouyang brusquely shunned. In another subplot, a master swordsman (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) is slowly going blind. He agrees to defend a village from horse thieves so that he can afford to go home and see his wife before his eyesight fails completely.

The farm is wroked by Sarah Anders, whose husband is away fighting for the Confederate Army. Far from the great armies and battlefields, a very private civil war erupts. The Captain and Sarah are pulled apart by the war's undertow into choices they can not fully control or understand. Each character in this drama must decide whether loyalty will be paid in blood. This story has a relevance to current partisan conflicts. Armies are not filled with murdering psychopaths. Good people can be driven to do bad things. The story chronicles the pathology of war, how escalating events can trigger unasked-for tragedy. Based on a true story about a southern child who shot and killed a union soldier during the Civil War.

Gene Kelly is at his toe-tapping best as Jerry Mulligan, a former GI who dreams of finding success as an artist.  A chance encounter with shopgirl Lise (Leslie Caron), however, throws his life into a whirlwind of romantic roundabouts.  Featuring the uplifting number, 'I Got Rhythm', and a spectacular ballet finale played out to Gershwin's titular score, An American in Paris remains one of the finest examples of the musical form.

That was critic Robin Wood's astute 1968 evaluation ten years after Alfred Hitchcock's final collaboration with James Stewart had been released to indifferent box office and unappreciative reviews. Tragic, obsessive and backed by an unforgettable Bernard Herrmann score, it's one of the director's most mesmerizing accomplishments. It knocked Citizen Kane off its nearly 50 year perch as the #1 picture of all time in the 2012 Sight and Sound decade poll of critics and filmmakers.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Regina (Audrey Hepburn) flees with Peter (Cary Grant) away from greedy pursuers after her dead husband's fortune.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn star in this stylish comedy-thriller directed by Stanley Donen, very much in a Hitchcock vein. Grant plays Peter Joshua, who meets Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) in Paris and later offers to help her when she discovers that her husband has been murdered. After the funeral, Reggie is summoned to the embassy and warned by agent/friend Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) that her late husband helped steal 250,000 dollars during the war and that the rest of the gang is after the money as well. When three of the men who attended her husband's funeral begin to harass her, Reggie goes to Joshua for help, at which time Joshua confesses that his name is actually Alexander Dyle, the brother of a fourth accomplice in the gold theft. The three men from the funeral are revealed to be the three other accomplices in the crime, and though she knows next to nothing of the heist, Reggie is caught in a ring of suspense as she is followed by the shadowy trio, all after the money. Apparently, the only person she can trust is Joshua/Dyle -- until Bartholomew tells Reggie that the fourth accomplice had no brother, and Joshua/Dyle reveals that he is, in fact, a crook named Adam Canfield. Now Reggie doesn't know where to turn. The musical score by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini was nominated for an Academy Award.

zaC2bWF60A8,Joe Dante on TO BE OR NOT TO BE,"Jack Benny's greatest movie role, and no wonder--it was written especially for him by Ernst Lubitsch! Carole Lombard's swan song earned her some of her finest reviews posthumously, but the film itself, daringly dark for the time, was generally regarded as an insensitive and even troubling satire of wartime issues. The title refers not only to Shakespeare but the questionable existence of Poland. It has since been recognized as one of the director's finest efforts and a brilliantly cast comedy classic. Remade in 1983 with Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft in the leads.

Monty Python delivers the group's sharpest and smartest satire of both religion and Hollywood's epic films.  Set in 33 A.D. Judea where the exasperated Romans try to impose order, it is a time of chaos and change with no shortage of messiahs and follwers willing to belive in them.  At its center is Brian Cohen, born in Bethleham in a stable next door, who, by a series of absurd circumstances is caught up in the new religion and reluctantly mistaken for the promised messiah, providing ample opportunity for the entire ensemble (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) to shine in mulitple roles as they question everyone and everything from ex-lepers, Pontius Pilate and haggling to revolutionaries, crazy prophets, religious fanaticism, Roman centurions and crucifixion, forever changing our biblical view.",810837,2150,126,171,0,0.2624128205128205

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
After a simple jewelery heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In 1992, Reservoir Dogs transformed Quentin Tarantino practically overnight from an obscure, unproduced screenwriter and part-time actor to the most influential new filmmaker of the 1990s. The story looks at what happens before and after (but not during) a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the rat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana.

DDE9kXwG0fs,Allan Arkush on THE DOORS,"Oliver Stone’s bio-pic about 60’s prog-rock band The Doors spent over ten years in development, running through several studios and potential leading men before settling on Val Kilmer as the band’s self-aggrandizing/self-destructive lead singer, Jim Morrison. Critical reaction was mixed and the box-office weak, but all of Oliver Stone’s films are passion projects and The Doors is no different: like Morrison himself, Stone’s movie is never dull or doctrinaire.

4wBUnziyPWQ,John Landis on GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS,"Director James Foley’s adaptation of David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize winning play was a box office flop but has gained in stature due to its remarkable cast and viciously funny set-pieces  (Alec Baldwin’s “Always Be Closing” is kissing cousin to Gordon Gecko’s “Greed is Good”). The pressure cooker plot about four real estate agents fighting for their jobs in a claustrophobic Chicago office space is punctuated by Mamet’s memorably mean-spirited dialogue which is delivered by some of the finest actors of the time including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin and Ed Harris. Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and Lemmon was voted Best Actor by the National Board of Review.

Probably the best known of all the screen adaptations of Tennessee Williams' plays, this is also one of the finest, thanks partly to the intensely claustrophobic hot-house atmosphere created by Elia Kazan's intimate direction, and partly to the young Marlon Brando's trademark blend of subtle detail and charismatic power.

The Funeral is a 1996 American crime-drama film directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Annabella Sciorra, Isabella Rossellini, Vincent Gallo, Benicio del Toro and Gretchen Mol.

The story concerns the funeral of one of three brothers in a family of gangsters that lived in New York in 1930s. It is a film that details the past of the brothers and their families through a series of flashbacks. The film is most notable for its shocking climax.

Chris Penn won the best supporting actor award at the 1996 Venice Film Festival for his performance.

Plot:

The film begins with the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers. These men are violent criminals. Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating. Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks show us that Johnny was more sensitive. Exposure to Communist meetings as a spy sway Johnny's opinions.

The chief suspect in Johnny's murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.

Ray and Chez swear revenge. Ray's wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez' wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband's obsessive nature.

As it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who first claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend, but who later admits, just before Ray kills him, that he wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends.

As he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers' lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray's house and shoots Ray's bodyguards, shoots his dead brother Johnny lying in the casket, shoots Ray, and then puts the gun in his own mouth and commits suicide as the family women wail over Ray as he too dies.",89780,318,53,141,0,0.3392818181818182

o-085q_GK5E,Plutonium Circus - documentary,"Directed by George Ratliff.

Funny yet incisive look at the PANTEX Nuclear Weapons Plant, in Amarillo, TX, which was used for nuclear weapons assembly during the Cold War. The plant, which provides most of the jobs for those living in Amarillo, now operates as a disassembly-line where the weapons, which were once built there, are now being taken apart with the plutonium getting stored underground. The film deals with the issues of storing the plutonium and the effects the plant has had (and is having) on the town of Amarillo, as well as how it has affected the way people thought about the Cold War and its aftermath. It does so by taking a look at the lives and activities of the Amarillo residents directly or indirectly associated with, or having strong opinions about the Plant.

The Fog was remade in 2005, directed by Rupert Wainwright and starring Selma Blair.

Bob Roberts Trailer - Directed by Tim Robbins and starring Tim Robbins, Giancarlo Esposito, Alan Rickman, Ray Wise, Brian Murray. Mock documentary about an upstart candidate for the U.S. Senate written and directed by actor Tim Robbins. Bob Roberts is a folksinger with a difference: He offers tunes that protest welfare chiselers, liberal whining, and the like. As the filmmakers follow his campaign, Robbins gives needle-sharp insight into the way candidates manipulate the media.

drys1OnF35E,PATHS OF GLORY New Original Masters of Cinema Trailer,"Here is the all-new original Masters of Cinema trailer for PATHS OF GLORY!

A shattering masterpiece by one of the medium’s greatest artists, Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory announced the definitive arrival of a towering figure in cinema.

In the French front lines of World War I, after giving the order for an impossible and disastrous mission to capture a nearby stronghold, the upper ranks move to save face by having three randomly selected soldiers held and tried for cowardice under pain of death. Their leader, Colonel Dax (in a powerhouse performance by Kirk Douglas) a former lawyer in civilian life, handles their defence against overwhelming odds.

A stylistically astonishing, emotionally overwhelming anti-war drama, Paths of Glory is one of the screen’s most brilliant condemnations of the power structures guiding warfare. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present a new Blu-ray edition for the first time in the UK from 19 Sept 2016.

S6ruDPy5isk,Ti West on RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK,"In 1981, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas paid homage to the adventure serials of the thirties and forties and in doing so gave a hot-foot to contemporary action films. Spielberg’s brilliant staging of the familiar clichés from those beloved b-movies gave them a new lease on life and captivated younger audiences who showed up to the theaters in droves. Starring Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, the bookish archaeologist and sometime action hero with a pathological fear of snakes (of course there are many snakes in this film). John Williams contributed the rousing score and Douglas Slocombe provided immaculate widescreen photography fit for a David Lean epic.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Colonel Shaw (Matthew Broderick) leads his company at the battle of Antietam.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the Civil War. Simply put, the heroes involved have been ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, headed by Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers are denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; as in armies past and future, they are given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. Still, none of the soldiers quit the regiment when given the chance. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner, SC, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. Glory was based on Lincoln Kirstein's Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard's One Gallant Rush; the latter book was founded on the letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the real-life character played by Matthew Broderick. The film won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for co-star Denzel Washington, and additional statuettes for Best Cinematography (Freddie Francis) and Sound Recording.

http://www.bfi.org.uk/whats-on/bfi-film-releases/touch-evil

“A brilliant fusion of pulp art with continental sophistication; it has all the energetic cruddiness of a Sammy Fuller ‘B’ picture, and all the self-consciousness of a New Wave melodrama.”
James Naremore, The Magic World of Orson Welles, 1978

Charlton Heston (starring here as Mexican border cop Mike Vargas) was apparently instrumental in persuading B-movie producer Albert Zugsmith to hire Orson Welles – who hadn’t directed in Hollywood for a decade – to make Touch of Evil.

Beginning with one of the most celebrated tracking shots in cinema history, a bravura three-minute take in which a bomb is planted in a car that then explodes after crossing the US border, Welles created a baroque, highly stylised masterpiece from inauspiciously pulpy source material.

With its story of murder, marijuana and police corruption, Touch of Evil is considered among the last of the 1940s/50s cycle of crime thrillers known as film noir. Welles’ vivid turn as corpulent bent cop Quinlan provided one of the genre’s most memorable villains.

Iniquity south of the border also colours Welles’ prior film noir, The Lady from Shanghai (1947), starring his then-wife Rita Hayworth.

_TpKN9Tq9aQ,John Landis on DUCK SOUP,"Duck Soup, arguably the Marx Brothers’ best film, is also one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made. Director Leo McCarey gave the picture a disciplined structure that still allowed his anarchistic stars plenty of room to wreak havoc, resulting in an absurdist comedy with an undercurrent of no-nonsense political commentary. This 1933 classic could be seen as the spiritual father of the darkly comic anti-war films that emerged in the sixties including Dr. Strangelove and How I Won the War.

Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of modern horror is widely considered to be the most terrifying movie of all time.

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel, this tale of a family man and would-be writer (Jack Nicholson) going mad as winter caretaker of the cursed Overlook Hotel is a seminal work of the genre. It is also, as Martin Scorsese has pointed out, like no other horror film ever made -- 'essentially unclassifiable, endlessly provocative and profoundly disturbing'. The BFI will release a magnificent new digital transfer from Warner Bros. of the US version which has never before been released in the UK and which -- at 144 minutes -- runs 24 minutes longer than the European version previously seen.

Engaged in battle against Germany's Field Marshal Rommel, Patton drives back ""The Desert Fox"" by using the German's own tactics. Promoted to Lieutenant General, Patton is sent to Sicily, where he engages in a personal war of egos with British Field Marshal Montgomery. Performing brilliantly in Italy, Patton seriously jeopardizes his future with a single slap. While touring an Army hospital, the General comes across a GI suffering from nervous fatigue. Incensed by what he considers a slacker, Patton smacks the poor soldier and orders him to get well in a hurry. This incident results in his losing his command-and, by extension, missing out on D-Day. In his final campaign, Patton leads the US 3rd Army through Europe. Unabashedly flamboyant, Patton remains a valuable resource, but ultimately proves too much of a ""loose cannon"" in comparison to the more level-headed tactics of his old friend Omar Bradley.",684731,1178,212,279,0,0.10717700000000001

Watch your back as the trendsetters of Westerberg High School are chewing up the scenery and may just have you in their evil sights in this razor-sharp black comedy about peer group peril. Up to her neck in vitriol and sick of it, popular teenager Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder, Edward Scissorhands) finds herself in a tiresome tide of ins and outs, part of a cruel social clique so wrapped up in their own making that no one else stands a chance. She decides to challenge the malevolent rule of the self-appointed divas of the school scene, the Heathers (Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker), and begins a torrid journey of blackmail, sex, revenge and murder. With the aid of rebellious newcomer Jason Dean (Christian Slater, True Romance) Veronica is set to revolutionise the classroom and turn popular perception upside down. Heathers, the original '80s cult classic, returns us to a time of 'swatch dogs', 'diet coke heads' and a bunch of croquet playing queen bees that will have you laughing to the last despicable gasp. Lick it up baby, and get in line, because 'bulimia is so '87!'",149593,1224,56,108,0,0.007581818181818183

Or in this case, the lack of personality: as Chance, a gentle shut-in untouched by the outside world except for what little knowledge he’s gleaned from TV, Sellers turns in a studious portrait of a completely vacant man. Directed by Hal Ashby from Jerzy Kozinski’s 1970 novel, the film co-stars Shirley MacLaine, Jack Warden and, in an Oscar-winning performance, Melvyn Douglas.

Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins star in director Francis Ford Coppola's visually stunning, passionately seductive version of the classic Dracula legend. In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Coppola returns to the original source of the Dracula myth, and from that gothic romance, he creates a modern masterpiece. Gary Oldman's metamorphosis as Dracula who grows from old to young, from man to beast is nothing short of amazing. Winona Ryder brings equal intensity to the role of a young beauty who becomes the object of Dracula's devastating desire. Anthony Hopkins co-stars as the famed doctor who dares to believe in Dracula, and then dares to confront him. Opulent, dazzling and utterly irresistible, this is Dracula as you've never seen him. And once you've seen Bram Stoker's Dracula, you'll never forget it.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive), goaded by an even madder scientist (Ernest Thesinger), builds his monster(Boris Karloff) a mate (Elsa Lanchester).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This greatest of all Frankenstein movies begins during a raging thunderstorm. Warm and cozy inside their palatial villa, Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon), Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton), and Shelley's wife Mary (Elsa Lanchester) engage in morbidly sparkling conversation. The wicked Byron mockingly chastises Mary for frightening the literary world with her recent novel Frankenstein, but Mary insists that her horror tale preached a valuable moral, that man was not meant to dabble in the works of God. Moreover, Mary adds that her story did not end with the death of Frankenstein's monster, whereupon she tells the enthralled Byron and Shelley what happened next. Surviving the windmill fire that brought the original 1931 Frankenstein to a close, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly revives and goes on another rampage of death and destruction. Meanwhile, his ailing creator Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) discovers that his former mentor, the demented Doctor Praetorius (Ernst Thesiger), plans to create another life-sized monster -- this time a woman! After a wild and wooly ""creation"" sequence, the bandages are unwrapped, and the Bride of the Monster (Elsa Lanchester again) emerges. Alas, the Monster's tender efforts to connect with his new Mate are rewarded only by her revulsion and hoarse screams. ""She hate me,"" he growls, ""Just like others!"" Wonderfully acted and directed, The Bride of Frankenstein is further enhanced by the vivid Franz Waxman musical score; even the film's occasional lapses in logic and continuity (it was trimmed from 90 to 75 minutes after the first preview) are oddly endearing. Director James Whale was memorably embodied by Ian McKellen in the Oscar-winning 1998 biopic Gods and Monsters.

A naive woman living in a remote Calvinist community on the Scottish coast, Bess (Emily Watson in an Academy Award® nominated performance) flaunts the will of the town's austere churchmen to marry Jan (Stellan Skarsgård, Good Will Hunter) a lusty Swede working in a nearby offshore oil rig. Her purity is put to the ultimate test when Jan is crippled in an accident and she agrees to continue their love-making vicariously through other men. Pilloried as a harlot, Bess is committed to the asylum but not before she seeks Jan's recovery through one final act of faith. Captured through Robby Mueller's (Paris, Texas) raw, relentless hand-held camera, this triumphant tale of tragedy, faith and redemption - the first in Lars Von Trier's ""Golden Heart"" trilogy on saintly heroines book-ended by Dancer in the Dark - is a cinematic tour de force.",134562,460,25,130,0,0.4174176470588235

rsBx_eTVSpQ,Donnie Brasco Trailer [HD],"Donnie Brasco - You may not notice the HD quality, but there is a bit diffrence. I personally love this movie, and therefore I got the trailer and batched it to HD quality. I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, i got the orginal DVD, and i promise you.. It´s worth buying. I´ll give it 6 stars.. It´s brilliant acting, great plot.. I´ve seen it 20 times +, and I´ll never stop watching it.

Donnie Brasco is an Academy Awardnominated 1997 film by Mike Newell, starring Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Johnny Depp. It is loosely based on the real-life events of Joseph D. Pistone, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who successfully infiltrated the Bonanno crime family, one of the Mafia's Five Families based in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias ""Donnie Brasco"". Depp met with Pistone several times while preparing for his role.

In the late 1970s, FBI agent Joe Pistone (Depp) is assigned to infiltrate the New York Citybased Bonanno crime family. Calling himself, ""Donnie Brasco"" and posing as a diamond expert from Vero Beach, Florida, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino), a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters, and Dominick ""Sonny Black"" Napolitano (Madsen). Lefty can't seem to make any money, his son is a drug-addict and he is continually passed over for promotion to a higher position within the crime family. He continually reminds Brasco of his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years in the Mafia (and killing 26 people), with little to show for it. In Donnie, however, Lefty sees a young protégé who might be able to succeed where he had failed. He takes Donnie under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly becomes accepted by the other Family members, although he is never elevated above the rank of ""associate"" member (the lowest mafia rank). But the longer Pistone plays the role of a gangster, the more he finds himself actually becoming Donnie Brasco during his rare off duty hours. His change in personality drives a wedge between him and his wife (played by Anne Heche) and three children. Over time, Pistone comes to realize that the slightest mistake in his performance as a mobster could result in the death of him and his family. In addition, Joe Pistone has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend. He knows that when the day finally comes that the FBI arrests his mob associates, he will be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he himself had killed him.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Adapted Screenplay

Claude is a cute, young, slightly butch, skateboarding teenager who has a thing for her messed-up best friend, Ellen

Ellen however has a thing for an asshole homophobe. Enter Luke, a self-assured gay musican, who encourages Claude to actually explore her feelings and perceptions of herself and the world that she lives in.

Claude's life is falling apart as those around her continue to destroy themselves in an orgy of drug abuse that eventually leads to murder. Thanking Luke's advice, she finds her way to the local lesbian bar where she meets Lucy, a cute punkish girl playing in an all girld band. But is this the lifestyle that Claude really wants?

Award-winning, convention-busting, against the grain and bursting with attitude  All Over Me is essential viewing for anyone who has fallen in love, made the mixtape and suffered the consequences.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A comic book artist (Ben Affleck) falls in love with a woman (Joey Lauren Adams) before finding out that she is a lesbian.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After a pair of films about hipster slackers, the work of writer-director Kevin Smith matured and gained critical respect with this low budget, independent comedy-drama about love, sex and the fine line between the two. Ben Affleck stars as Holden McNeil, a New Jersey comic book writer who is roommates with his best friend and professional partner, artist Banky Edwards (Jason Lee). Their hit comic book series, ""Bluntman and Chronic,"" is loosely patterned after a pair of acquaintances, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Smith), two characters already familiar as supporting players in several Smith films. Into Holden's life comes Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a lesbian and fellow comic book creator who quickly becomes a close friend, although Holden is powerfully attracted to her. Eventually, Alyssa realizes that she is attracted to Holden as well and they begin a physical relationship, much to the consternation of Banky, whose ire over losing his best friend to a lesbian seems to border on romantic jealousy. After he learns something about Alyssa's sexual past, however, Holden's immature response to his new knowledge destroys both his romance with Alyssa and his friendship with Banky. Chasing Amy (1997) was the third film in what Smith referred to as his ""New Jersey series,"" films set at least partly in the Garden State and featuring the Jay and Silent Bob characters.

EcWK0M4VMjA,'I Know What You Did Last Summer' - Trailer (1997),"WARNING! SPOILERS IN DESCRIPTION!

Directed By: Jim Gillespie
Starring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Johnny Galecki, Bridgette Wilson, Anne Heche, Muse Watson

Plot:
The night of their high school graduation, Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Philippe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr) go out of town to celebrate. Returning in Barry's new car, they hit and apparently kill a man. They dump the corpse in the ocean and agree to never discuss again what had happened.
One year later Julie is returning home from college. She has not spoken with Helen, Barry or Ray since the accident. Julie receives a letter that reads ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!"" Julie goes to see Helen's sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson), who tells Julie that Helen has been working there. Julie shows Helen the letter and they decide to visit Barry. After going over the incident, Barry accuses Max. The three of them go to see Max, but Barry insists on going in the factory alone. Barry persuades Max to go into the back room and attacks him, telling Max he should keep his mouth shut. Julie finds Ray working on the docks. Ray tries to make up with Julie but she runs off. Inside the factory Max is murdered by someone wielding a hook. The killer attacks Barry next, running him over with Barry's car. The killer is shown wearing a raincoat and wielding a hook on one hand.
Julie arrives at the hospital to see Barry and finds Helen and Ray there. Julie reveals the man they hit was named David Eagen. Helen and Julie track his sister, Missy (Anne Heche), to her home, where she has been living since her brother's death. Missy does not recognise them and Julie is convinced she is innocent. Missy tells them she had a visit from a man claiming to be David's friend named Billy Blue.
At Helen's home that night, the killer breaks in, hiding in her closet. The next morning Helen wakes up with most of her hair cut to bits and ""SOON"" written in lipstick on her mirror. Julie gets a call from Barry, who tells her to come to Helen's. On the way, Julie hears rattling in her trunk. She opens the trunk to find Max's body. She shuts the trunk, runs to Helen's and brings her and Barry to her car, but the body has disappeared. Julie is convinced the killer took the body and they are not safe. Later they run into Ray, who tells them he got a letter. Julie decides to see Missy again while Helen and Barry watch each other's backs at the parade. Julie tries to convince Missy that David did not kill himself after Missy presents her with a suicide note written in the same style as her letter from the killer. Missy tells Julie to leave.
At the Croaker pageant, Helen sees Barry murdered by the killer. However, neither the killer nor the body are found afterwards. A police officer drives her home, but the killer lures the cop into an alley and kills him. Helen runs to her store where Elsa is working, but the killer finds and murders both of them.
Julie learns that the killer is Ben Willis, a fisherman. He murdered David Egan after David and Ben's daughter Susie were involved in a car crash near where the four teenagers hit Ben. Susie was killed in the accident and David was unharmed. Ben blamed David and killed him a year later, making it look like a suicide. On the way home, Ben was hit by the group.
Julie goes to see Ray on his boat and tells him the story, but he does not believe her. Julie notices the name on his boat is ""Billy Blue"" and accuses him of the murders. He chases her but is knocked unconscious by a man who tells Julie to get on his boat. After she does, she learns he is Ben Willis. She is chased all over the boat while Ray regains consciousness and steals a boat to save Julie. In a room full of ice, Julie finds Helen and Barry's bodies. Ray climbs aboard and is almost killed by Ben, but is caught in the boat's net. He climbs back aboard and saves Julie. Ben gets his hand caught in a rope and Ray hoists him into the air where his hand is cut off and he falls into the ocean. On land, Ray tells Julie the reason he went to see Missy was because he was guilty and had to know who they hit. He tells her he loves her and they embrace. Ben's body is not recovered.
A year later, Julie is in her second year and is going on a trip to New York with Ray. She receives a letter resembling the one she had got from Ben, but it only contains a pool party invitation. Julie returns to the bathroom, which has filled with steam. On the shower door, ""I STILL KNOW"" is written. Ben jumps through the shower door, attacking her.",1473532,3338,656,139,0,0.209664

But the script is a mess, presumably because the filmmakers were chasing a manic, screwball tone that leaves the audience confused.

Eddie Adams would have been just another high-school drop-out had he not met the likes of adult film director Jack Horner. Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift. Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the film is a tribute to the decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era. Everyone's born with one special thing, and Eddie Adams uses his humongous ""asset"" to take the world of film pornography by storm. Things get ugly though when success leads to drugs and ruin.

Director: Peter Weir
Starring: Jim Carrey, Ed Harris and Laura Linney.

Nominated for 3 Oscars, including Best Director and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ed Harris)

The Truman Show is a 1998 American satirical comedy-drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol. The cast includes Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, as well as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone. The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast 24-hours-a-day to billions of people across the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.

The genesis of The Truman Show was a spec script by Niccol. The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script, and instantly set the project up at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was in contention to direct before Weir took over, managing to make the film for $60 million against the estimated $80 million budget. Niccol rewrote the script simultaneously as the filmmakers were waiting for Carrey's schedule to open up for filming. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.

The film was a financial and critical success, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards and The Saturn Awards. The Truman Show has been analyzed as a thesis on Christianity, simulated reality, existentialism and the rise of reality television.

Plot:
An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A female flight attendant (Pam Grier) becomes a key figure in a plot between the police and an arms dealer.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed this adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1995 Rum Punch, switching the action from Miami to LA, and altering the central character from white to black. Ruthless arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), who lives with perpetually stoned beach-babe Melanie (Bridget Fonda), teams with his old buddy Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), just released from prison after serving four years for armed robbery. ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) bust stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), who was smuggling money into the country for Ordell. Ordell springs Jackie, but when middle-aged bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) picks her up at the jail, he's attracted to her, and they choose a romantic route with detours. Mistrust and suspicions surface after Jackie pits Ordell and the cops against each other, convincing Ordell that she's going to double-cross the cops. Tarantino commented on the film's budget: ""Jackie Brown only cost $12 million. You can't lose. You absolutely, positively can't lose. And you don't have to compromise.""

Interweaving dream logic with satire, melodrama, surrealism, and everyday reality, it dives headfirst into the craziness and contradictions of sexual relations between men and women, and the soulful search for understanding and love.",11206,14,1,196,0,0.9447

Director: Randall Wallace
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, Gérard Depardieu and John Malkovich.

The Man in the Iron Mask is a 1998 British/American historical action film directed, produced, and written by Randall Wallace. It uses characters from Alexandre Dumas' D'Artagnan Romances, and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. It also bears several similarities with the 1939 film version. The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film.

Plot: 
The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king?

kg_jH47u480,Armageddon - Official® Trailer [HD],"Release Date: July 1, 1998

Michael Bay (The Rock) directed this science fiction action thriller in the When Worlds Collide tradition. After astronomy students discover a comet-asteroid collision, an asteroid fragment ""the size of the Super Dome"" threatens. It's destroyed by a secret USA defense in space, but a large chunk veers off toward Singapore. With another asteroid ""the size of Texas"" en route, a plan is devised to send oil drillers to land on the asteroid and drop a nuclear device down a 1000-foot shaft, a scheme calculated to crack the asteroid into two halves, saving Earth. NASA begins a crash program to train beer-besotted oil roughnecks for the mission. During a stopover to refuel at the Mir Station, the space station is accidentally destroyed, so a Russian cosmonaut also joins the team. Produced by Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer (Con Air), and Gale Anne Hurd (The Relic, The Abyss).

Lewis Milestone (who took home a directing Oscar along with the Best Picture award) imported tons of WW I German and French military equipment in his quest for authenticity. DP Karl Freund suggested the indelible concluding butterfly sequence. Star Lew Ayres, a genuine pacifist whose career suffered a decade later, served selflessly in WW II in noncombat positions.

uPe27x0_W2M,Chariots of Fire - New Trailer - In cinemas July 13,"Chariots of Fire will be release into cinemas July 13th.

Chariots of Fire tells the story of two very different men who compete as runners in the 1924 Paris Olympics: 

Eric Liddell is a devout Christian who believes that his athletic abilities are a gift from God, and that using that gift to its fullest extent - to win the gold medal - will be his way of repaying that gift. 

Harold Abrahams is an English Jew, a student at Cambridge, who dreams of fame and of proving to his anti-Semitic fellow students, and to the world, that Jews are in no respect inferior. 
Their motives are noble. Their commitment is total. Their integrity is unquestionable. They will both make personal sacrifices to achieve their goals. In the process, through all the obstacles and personal issues they conquer, they prove that striving for victory in their own terms is, perhaps, its own reward. 

Based on a true story, CHARIOTS OF FIRE was the winner of four Academy Awards®, including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, in addition to receiving nominations for three more.

Repo Man:
The cult classic from 1984, Repo Man is a dark, post-apocalyptic comedy thriller centred on two car repossession men making fast bucks in the seamy, seedy LA underworld. 

Otto (Emilio Estevez - The Breakfast Club) is an alienated punk wandering the LA streets before a coke-sniffing Bud (Harry Dean Stanton - Paris, Texas), an aging repossession man, offers him money to drive a car out of a bad neighbourhood. 

Soon enough, Otto is earning big money under Bud's tutelage but their latest repo job lands them in hot water when a nuclear physicist leaves something toxic - a nuclear device, an alien? - in the trunk of a 1964 Chevy... As the acerbic Bud advises his apprentice: ''A repo man's life is always intense.'' Well remembered for its bizarre, eccentric characters and dystopic vision of America, director Alex Cox's (Sid and Nancy - 1986) fresh and darkly humorous urban fable is rounded out by a classic theme song from Iggy Pop.",8206,34,3,1740,0,0.5824333333333334

Inaccuracies
The movie incorrectly presents many aspects of Polish culture. Czarnina (duck blood soup) although very popular until the 19th century is rarely eaten now. Kielbasa (sausage), especially cooked is rarely consumed for breakfast, while each meal in the movie contains it. Music played in the film is of Balcan origin. Procession of the Virgin and selection of a virgin to lead it does not happen in the Polish Roman Catholic church. The movie plays off a number of inaccurate stereotypes. Obsession over a large number of offspring is perhaps a 19th century phenomenon, while smoking and shouting at the table are not accepted in Polish culture.",101718,108,34,89,0,0.29514074074074076
Nmb1g4SYIM0,"5 Minute Features: This World, Then the Fireworks","Here is volume 2 of the 5 Minute Feature Film series, this time on Michael Oblowitz's adaptation of Jim Thompson's This World, Then the Fireworks. The 5 Minute Feature Film series is where I take a full length movie and cut it down to 5 minutes in length, re-score it, but tell basically the same story, while simultaneously analyzing the film. You can find part one here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYM7mmakRrs&context=C459aeb4ADvjVQa1PpcFMYs4RUQYrgcQmwA2q_KX0ht3SFhm2Sq-k=, where I made a 5 minute version of the Nicolas Cage/Nicole Kidman vehicle Trespass.

This World, Then the Fireworks, starring Billy Zane, Gina Gershon, Sheryl Lee, and Rue McClanahan, is a very post-modern look at film noir, like a David Lynch film, but with less consistency of vision (I uploaded the original EPK for the film on Youtube which hammers that point even more). I reviewed the film here: http://regrettablesincerity.com/?p=8458 , and by reading that piece, you'll understand my editing choices. What's most interesting is that because of Oblowitz's style, and how it would eventually completely reveal itself on the two Steven Seagal DTV movies he made (Out for a Kill and The Foreigner), the opening montage of This World, Then the Fireworks which sets up the tone of the film and the entire story, is practically incoherent. It's cut so quickly and in such a flashy manner that there's very little way to take in the important information, so, despite cutting a 100 minute film down to 5 minutes, I actually had to slow down the opening montage to make sure you could understand what was going on. The rest of the movie is less rushed, though it still has a twitchy nature to it, and my editing was aided by the broad performances and theatrical gestures by Zane, Gershon, and especially Lee.

The music you'll hear in this Five Minute Feature is from Tchaikovsky's Symphony Pathetique and Django Reinhardt's Bouncin' Around.",9719,27,18,282,0,0.49498000000000003
7j8Ba9rWhUg,Metropolis (restoration trailer),"http://www.kino.com/metropolis/
Metropolis is a 1927 silent science fiction film directed by Fritz Lang and written by Lang and Thea von Harbou. Lang and von Harbou, who were married, wrote the screenplay in 1924, and the story was novelized by von Harbou in 1926. It is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and examines a common science fiction theme of the day: the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism. The film stars Alfred Abel as the leader of the city, Gustav Fröhlich as his son, who tries to mediate between the elite caste and the workers, Brigitte Helm as both the pure-at-heart worker Maria and the debased robot version of her, and Rudolf Klein-Rogge as the mad scientist who created the robot.

Metropolis was produced in Germany in the Babelsberg Studios by Universum Film A.G. (UFA) and released in 1927 during a stable period of the Weimar Republic. The most expensive film of its time, it cost approximately 7 million Reichsmark to make. The film was cut substantially after its German premiere, and there have been several efforts to restore it. Also, the American copyright lapsed in 1953, which eventually led to a proliferation of versions being released on video.

Did you know that ""Herbie Goes Bananas"" was in fact going to be a TV movie pilot for a potential new TV series? This explains the ""new"" faces and a slight lack of quality. Herbie did in fact get a short lived TV series collectively called ""Herbie The Matchmaker"" in the early 1980s. This TV series did actually get Dean Jones back to reprise his role of Jim Douglas.

This film is considered the last true (just) Herbie feature film ever made.

Winnie (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker) e Mary (Kathy Najimy) são três bruxas do século XVII, que chegam ao século XX após seus espíritos serem evocados no Dia das Bruxas. Banidas há 300 anos devido à prática de feitiçaria, elas estão dispostas a tudo para garantir sua juventude e imortalidade. Porém precisarão enfrentar três crianças e um gato falante, que podem atrapalhar seus planos.

Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy  romp around like coked-up versions of The Three Stooges in the frantic Disney romp Hocus Pocus. The film begins in 1693 where three witches -- Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy) -- are preparing a potion that will grant them immortality and eternal youth. But before they finish mixing their cocktail, the people of Salem capture them and execute them for practicing witchcraft. Before their deaths, they vow to return to Salem 300 years hence on Halloween to exact their revenge. Three hundred years later, a skeptical, newly transplanted Californian, Max (Omri Katz), explores the ruins of the legendary witches' house and dares the witches to manifest themselves. Disregarding the warnings of his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and girlfriend Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max lights the Candle of Black Flame. With that, the witches reappear to wreak havoc on the town. The kids take off with the witches' spellbook and a musty tome of hexes and recipes. The sorceresses, who will die by the morning light if they don't recite the incantation for immortality, have to get the books by whatever means they can. So, Winifred, Sarah, and Mary hop on their broomsticks for a chase through Halloween night. ~ Paul Brenner, All Movie Guide",708473,2259,283,1860,0,0.13442500000000002

plSdhHECZUo,Ti West on INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM,"In his 1984 sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Steven Spielberg takes his satirical approach to adventure movies and dials it up to 11. The result is one of the most propulsive action-comedies ever made with one head-spinning set piece after another. Its lighthearted approach aside, the film is faithful enough to its grisly pulp fiction roots that certain scenes (like a bloodthirsty high priest burrowing into an unlucky native’s chest to pluck out his heart) heralded the new PG-13 rating from the MPAA.

This time it’s the rabies-infected St. Bernard of Lewis Teague’s Cujo. The film’s frantically suspenseful climax helped make it a modest success in 1983 (the fourth-highest grossing horror film of the year). Teague’s in-your-face action scenes were abetted by editor Neil Travis (Terminator 3) and cinematographer Jan De Bont (eleven years before his directorial debut with Speed).

Qs6z1D4gVp4,Children Of The Corn (1984) - Official Trailer,"Based on Stephen King's book. A boy preacher named Isaac goes to a town in Nebraska called Gatlin and gets all the children to murder every adult in town. A young couple have a murder to report and they go to the nearest town (Gatlin) to seek help but the town seems deserted. They are soon trapped in Gatlin with little chance of getting out alive.

Some Trivia
----------------
Though real corn was used for most of filming, polyurethane corn had to be used for the more difficult action sequences.

The tagline ""And a child shall lead them"" comes from Isaiah 11:6 in the Old Testament, which reads, ""And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.""

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Inside the vampire club, Quinn (Donal Logue) starts a fight and demands that Blade (Wesley Snipes) be hurt badly.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
British director Stephen Norrington helmed this David S. Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blade's mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires. In the 1990s (in Marvel's Nightstalkers), Blade teamed with Drake and King in an agency created to fight a variety of supernatural beings. The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blade's mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire.

Though warned that Grant is little more than a fortune-hunter, Fontaine marries him anyway. She remains loyal to her irresponsible husband as he plows his way from one disreputable business scheme to another. Gradually, Fontaine comes to the conclusion that Grant intends to do away with her in order to collect her inheritance...a suspicion confirmed when Grant's likeable business partner Nigel Bruce dies under mysterious circumstances. Suspicion's stylish chills put Hitchcock on the top of the Hollywood heap...and keeps audiences on the edges of their seats to this day. So hang on for an-all suspence that's all-out Hitchcock!

The BFI National Archive proudly presents the restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Lodger' (1926), featuring a new score by Nitin Sawhney commissioned by Network Releasing in partnership with the BFI and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. This restoration is part of The Genius of Hitchcock, a major celebration of Britain's most influential and iconic filmmaker. From June to October 2012 the BFI celebrates Hitchcock's life and work with a complete retrospective of his feature films; gala events, including screenings of restorations with live music, educational projects and online initiatives. For full details see http://www.bfi.org.uk/hitchcock.

London is terrorised by a Jack the Ripper-style murderer in Hitchcock's first suspense thriller, acclaimed as 'the finest British production ever made' by the Bioscope journal on its release. Hitchcock cannily cast matinee idol Ivor Novello in the title role and challenged his audience to think the worst of him.

'The Lodger' is a restoration by the BFI National Archive in association with ITV Studios Global Entertainment, Network Releasing and Park Circus Films. Principal funding provided by The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, The Film Foundation, and Simon W Hessel.

All titles on the BFI Films channel are preserved in the vast collections of the BFI National Archive. To find out more about the Archive visit http://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections",26368,159,8,94,0,0.4272375

In it Daniel plays Henderson Dores, an uptight English art dealer who's transplanted himself to NYC and is doing his level best to embrace the American way of life. When his boss sends him to the American south to acquire a rare painting from Loomis Gage (Harry Dean Stanton), he must contend not only with the eccentric Gage but his entire wacko family. In this scene, Gage's daughter Cora (Glenne Headly) gives Henderson a piece of her mind - and he learns that looks are deceiving.

Stars and Bars was NOT warmly received upon its release, and it's a shame, since it appears to have scared Daniel off from trying his hand at comedy again. The film is by no means great, but Daniel's performance has a number of genuinely funny moments. Somebody release it on DVD already!",31171,134,24,140,0,0.4736333333333333

Life has just handed Beth Macauley the short straw. Her husband and suburban home are gone. She still has her two boys -- and a new destination. She's moving to the big city of Baltimore -- and into the biggest adventure of her life. Two-time Academy Award winner* Jessica Lange plays Beth in this warm-hearted, funny fable from Risky Business director Paul Brickman about staying together when all else is falling apart. Screen-debuting Chris O'Donnell (two years before his star making Scent of a Woman role) and Charlie Korsmo are the sons who unwittingly push Beth into one pitfall of single parenthood after another. Newcomers to Beth's world include an avant-garde composer (Arliss Howard), a flakier-than-cereal neighbor (Joan Cusack) and a boss (Kathy Bates) skilled in management by terror.

Directed By Paul Brickman
Starring Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Arliss Howard

Based on Kate Grenville's novel and inspired by a true story, Lilian's Story is a triumph of heart and spirit from the director of Struck By Lightning. For 40 years Lilian Singer has been locked up in a mental hospital by her father. Left to her own devices she has lived in a world of torment and despair completely shut off from the outside world. When Lilian's release is eventually secured by her eccentric Aunt Kitty and her brother John, she faces the great unknown and embraces it with passion and courage. Searching the streets of Sydney for the essence of love and affection she never received herself, Lilian's journey becomes one of self-realisation and underlying contentment. Explored through a series of moving flashbacks her story unfolds with a colourful rainbow of characters that rest between the dark clouds of her past. With outstanding dual performances from Toni Collette (in an AFI award winning performance) and Ruth Cracknell as Lilian, and supported by Barry Otto (Bliss) and John Flaus (Newsfront) Lilian's Story is both inspirational and rewarding.",13589,36,4,185,0,0.38065

M94yyfWy-KI,Edward Scissorhands (1990) - Trailer (HD/1080p),"Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American Romance, Horror, Gothic and fairy tale hybrid film directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. The film shows the story of an artificial man named Edward, an unfinished creation, who has scissors for hands. Edward is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim. Supporting roles are portrayed by Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin.
Burton conceived the idea for Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Caroline Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox, after Warner Bros. passed on the project. Edward Scissorhands was then fast tracked after Burton's success with Batman. Before Depp's casting, the leading role of Edward had been connected to Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Robert Downey, Jr., and William Hurt, while the role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and was ultimately his final performance on film.
The majority of filming took place in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, which generated over $6 million for the local economy. Edward's scissor hands were created and designed by Stan Winston. The film is also the fourth feature collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman. Edward Scissorhands was released with positive feedback from critics, and was a financial success. The film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Saturn Awards, as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work.

y3at2jY5AS4,Smoking & Pipe Smoking on Film: Peter Sellers,"This is a clip from the magnificent 1959 GB comedy 'Battle of the sexes' by Charles Crichton, starring Peter Sellers in one of his best performances ever. 

Until a few years ago my young niece wouldn't believe that when I had her age (the seventies) it was allowed to smoke in the cinema and that all the seats had built in little ash trays, like the ones they had on trains. 
This clip shows Peter Sellers as Mr. Martin, accountant with a firm that produces traditional Scottish tweed, trying to get rid of a newly appointed modern American bulldozer-style manager who gets on everyone's nerves and who goes too far when she suggests the company should move into synthetic fibres. Martin, having decided the only way left to him is to murder her, prepares himself by seeing a film in which a 'perfect murder' is committed, involving the use of delibererately left behind whiskey and tobacco  - the attributes which he then sets out to buy, not without difficulty as he himself doesn't  drink nor smoke...

SLAM, starring Saul Williams, Sonja Sohn, and Bonz Malone, is a powerful work of cinema verite that portrays the story of a young black performance poet, Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams), who is arrested and imprisoned for a petty marijuana charge in a Washington, D.C. jail. Although the confining prison walls do little to shield him from danger, it is within those walls that Raymond establishes his identity, strength and voice, and meets a prison gang leader (Bonz Malone) and a prison writing teacher, Lauren Bell (Sonja Sohn). Bell inspires Raymond to use the power of creative expression to free himself from the struggles and demise of the black male, as another victim of the judicial system. Sublime poetry and heart wrenching realism, SLAM is itself a testament to the importance and the impact of artistic expression. Directed by Marc Levin. Blowback Productions, 1998.

Here are 3 examples of storyboards helping us break down the action.

Y9WOMDsMy78,Trailer: The Stepford Wives (1975),"The 2004 remake of this film is light-hearted and rather fun, but if that is the only version that you have seen you are missing out. The original version, starring Katharine Ross might not have the humour, but it has a lot more depth to it, is truer to the plot of the original book. Like the book, it's rather scary.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
He's good at defending himself. He's good at disguising himself. He's good at getting himself into trouble...They call him Fletch (Chevy Chase).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Chevy Chase added a classic comic hero to the film landscape with Fletch, one of his few truly popular star vehicles in a famously misguided post-Saturday Night Live career. Chase plays Irwin M. Fletcher, known to everyone as Fletch, a Los Angeles Lakers-loving investigative reporter with a gleeful disdain for deadlines and a knack for pushing the buttons of his frustrated editor (Richard Libertini). He's also known for donning numerous disguises and assuming zany false identities to help gain information. While pursuing an ongoing story about a powerful drug dealer who operates from Venice Beach, he comes across an intriguing offshoot in which he becomes intimately involved. Aviation executive Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) has an unusual proposition for Fletch: If Fletch agrees to an elaborate plan to kill him, for reasons Stanwyk refuses to divulge beyond explaining that he has bone cancer, Fletch will walk away with a healthy sum of money and a plane ticket to Brazil. Curious yet suspicious by profession, Fletch begins investigating Stanwyk's true motives, which leads him through numerous misadventures. Among them are a visit to a stuffy country club; a high-speed car chase with an unwitting passenger; repeat encounters with Stanwyk's wife (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), although she may not be his only one; and a trip to Provo -- that's Utah, not Spain. Inspired by a novel of the same name by Gregory McDonald, Fletch went from thriller to comedy as it was adapted into a vehicle for Chase.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Ray (Michael Caine) uses the only thing that matters to LV -- her deceased father -- to get her to agree to playing a show.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Based on Jim Cartright's play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, this screen adaptation directed by Mark Herman is an underdog film about an underdog girl named Little Voice (or LV for short). LV (Jane Horrocks from Mike Leigh's Life is Sweet who does all her own singing) is a shy, mousy woman living with her mom Mari (Secrets and Lies' Brenda Blethyn). Little Voice doesn't leave her house. Instead she sings along to her record collection of Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, and Marilyn Monroe. Her mother Mari, however, is an outspoken woman who is convinced her sex appeal (which is little) will land her a man, especially when she's drunk. One night while bar-hopping, Mari meets the suave yet sleazy talent agent Ray Say (Michael Caine), whom she takes home for a nightcap. There Ray hears the beautiful Little Voice singing a perfect rendition of Judy Garland's ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" from The Wizard of Oz. He's stunned by its beauty and thinks he can make her a star. From there the story heads in complicated, romantic, and sweet-hearted directions that should not be given away. Also starring in this small independent film is Ewan McGregor.

LmhsWy7O54E,"Alan Spencer on RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD, PART 2","Any subtleties or ambiguous notions found in 1982’s First Blood are blown up real good in this 1985 sequel. Co-written by Stallone and James Cameron, the second film picks up right where the first left off as Rambo is released from prison in order to rescue a squadron of POWs in Vietnam. Directed by George Cosmatos, the explosion-happy picture benefits from stellar tech credits with TFH Guru Mark Goldblatt in the editing bay, an evocative score by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from the brilliant Jack Cardiff.

iGgug8_Tn1M,Alan Spencer on FIRST BLOOD,"As battle-scarred John Rambo, star and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone uses the post war traumas of real-life war veterans as fuel for a jingoistic revenge fantasy in the mode of Death Wish and Walking Tall. Efficiently directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, North Dallas Forty), 1982’s First Blood is the quintessential Reagan era action film; the beleaguered Rambo takes up arms against a corrupt Washington state police department and essentially goes to war with his own government. Andrew Lazlo’s (Southern Comfort, Innerspace) beautiful cinematography (utilizing the lush landscapes of British Columbia) recalls Vilmos Zsigmond’s work on The Deer Hunter and Jerry Goldsmith’s thoughtful score conveys an appropriately manly but melancholy mood.

Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and wife, Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), decide to take it easy on Christmas and host a big family get-together. Typical of the Griswold's, however, is the disaster that results.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Chevy Chase, star of National Lampoon's Vacation and its sequel, is back as the paterfamilias of the Griswold family (including Beverly D'Angelo as his missus) to skewer the Yuletide season. Chevy mugs, trips, falls, mashes his fingers and stubs his toes as he prepares to invite numerous dysfunctional relatives to his household to celebrate Christmas. Amidst the more outrageous sight gags (including the electrocution of a cat as the Christmas tree is lit) the film betrays a sentimental streak, with old wounds healing and long-estranged relatives reuniting in the Griswold living room. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was still capable of attracting an audience five years after its release -- it was one of the top-rated seasonal TV specials of 1994, outrating even the first network telecast of It's a Wonderful Life.

znESQTt3L80,YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998) - Official Movie Trailer,"You've Got Mail (1998) / Вам Письмо (Трейлер)
Director: Nora Ephron
Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Greg Kinnear.

Nominated for Golden Globe.

You've Got Mail is a 1998 American romantic comedy film released by Warner Bros. It is based on a manuscript of the same title written by the film's director, Nora Ephron, in which two letter-writing lovers are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. The film is a remake of the Ernst Lubitsch film The Shop Around the Corner. (There was also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime starring Judy Garland.) You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly — a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film.

The name of the film is an example of product placement, based on the trademark greeting that AOL users hear when they receive new e-mail. About one year later, AOL and Time Warner (the entertainment conglomerate that owns Warner Bros. studios, which released this film) announced a corporate merger.

The film received significant media coverage leading up to its release in anticipation of the romantic coupling of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who had appeared together previously in Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993).

Plot:
Two business rivals hate each other at the office but fall in love over the internet.

""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"".

Synopsis:

In this third sequel to slasher classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, four Texas teens are abducted by a family of psychos on their way home from the senior prom. Bloodshed, torture, and intrigue ensue. Barry (Tyler Cone) and Sean (John Harrison) meet their fates quickly, but semi-bimbo Heather (Lisa Newmyer) lasts long enough to be tortured and burned before having her head cracked open like a walnut by a mechanical leg. Meanwhile, sweet, befuddled Jenny (Renee Zellweger) actively resists her captors by stealing cars, breaking through windows, and jumping off roofs. Although Leatherface (Robert Jacks), the human skin-wearing transvestite based on real-life serial killer Ed Gein, is back on board, the cannibal cast this time out also includes several new characters, from bionic villain Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) to trashy realtor Darla (Tonie Perensky) and literature-quoting flunky W.E. (Joe Stevens). The plot also adds an X-Files-esque conspiracy to the basic Chainsaw concept in the form of deformed businessman Rothman (James Gale), who descends on the family of killers to critique their torture techniques. Written and directed by original Massacre scribe Kim Henkel, the film appeared at 1995 festivals in a 104-minute cut under the title The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre; after actors Zellweger and McConaughey became Hollywood stars, the film was re-titled, re-cut, and given a limited theatrical release in August of 1997. The nine minutes of deleted footage included scenes of Jenny's troubled home life. Both versions included brief cameos from Marilyn Burns, Paul Partain, and John Dugan -- all of whom appeared in Tobe Hooper's original film. Prodigious litigation preceded the film's re-release, although both the McConaughey and Zellweger camps denied attempting to block its release. The film's soundtrack includes a who's who of local Texas bands.

Dick Foran plays the high-spirited hero, Wallace Ford provides the comedy relief and former cowboy star Tom Tyler, with his shark-like black eyes, makes for a particularly spooky mummy.

bKyiXjyVsfw,Frankenstein (1931) Trailer,"When Universal released Frankenstein in 1931 the film was a very unique piece to watch. The film has always been regarded as a black and white classic when it was nothing of the sort. When audiences originally saw the film in theatres the daylight scenes were in amber, the night in pale blue, the eerie scenes in green and the fiery climax in red. Universal also thought it was necessary to hype the film up a bit. As if the film wasnt scary enough on its own the studio found it in their best interest to park an ambulance out in front of many theatres and to keep two nurses on hand in the lobby to raise the chill factor. They even went as far as to place an actress in the audience during every showing who would, at the scariest moment in the film, scream, jump out of her seat, and run up the aisle and out of the theatre. Too bad we dont see theatrics like that anymore.",317366,491,82,106,0,0.056128

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
An unlikely relationship blossoms between the most famous actress in the world (Julia Roberts) and a charming bookkeeper (Hugh Grant) living in Notting Hill.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Can a beautiful and internationally famous American actress find happiness with a frumpy British bookstore clerk? She can -- at least for a while, it seems -- in Notting Hill. William Thacker (played by Hugh Grant) is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend, Spike (Rhys Ifans). One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss -- just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family (not to mention the world at large) wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star. Notting Hill reunites Hugh Grant with producer Duncan Kenworthy and screenwriter Richard Curtis, who previously worked together on the international hit Four Weddings And A Funeral.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Otello (Plácido Domingo) rejoices in victory with his men, and then finishes the celebration with a passionate kiss from Desdemona (Katia Ricciarelli).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Having previously staged Verdi's 1887 opera Otello at the Met and La Scala, filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli committed his production to film in 1986. Starring as the fatally jealous Moor of Venice is Placido Domingo, who had also headlined Zeffirelli's 1976 La Scala staging (production on the film was briefly interrupted while Domingo participated in the rescue operations following the Mexico City earthquake). While Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona and Justino Diaz as Iago perform their own singing, Zeffirelli's Cassio--played by real-life European prince Urbano Barberini--is dubbed by Ezio de Cesare. The director made several cuts in the original libretto and score in order to accommodate the film's two-hour time limit, but these excisions are done with taste and discretion. Because of the excessive violence in the third act--two murders, a suicide, a superficial throat-slashing--Otello was released with a PG rating.

lAoT2ktM2H0,The Mission - Gabriel's Oboe (Full HD),"This is a clip of Gabriel's Oboe from a 1986 movie, The Mission.

About Gabriel Obe (source: Wikipedia)
--------------------------------------------------------
""Gabriel's Oboe"" is the main theme for the 1986 film The Mission directed by Roland Joffé. The theme was written by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, and has since been arranged and performed several times by artists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Holly Gornik, and Brynjar Hoff, among others. The theme has been called ""unforgettable"" and a ""celebrated oboe melody"". Vocalist Sarah Brightman begged Morricone to allow her to put lyrics to the theme to create her own song, ""Nella Fantasia"". In 2010, Morricone encouraged soprano Hayley Westenra to write English lyrics for ""Gabriel's Oboe"" in her album Paradiso.
The soundtrack for the film was very well received amongst critics, being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and earning Morricone the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.
In the film, the theme is most prominently used when the protagonist, the Jesuit Father Gabriel, walks up to a waterfall and starts playing his oboe, aiming to befriend the natives with his music so he can carry his missionary work in the New World. The Guaraní tribesmen, who have been stalking him from a distance, approach Gabriel for the first time, puzzled by the sounds of the unknown instrument. The chief of the tribe, however, is displeased by this, and breaks Gabriel's oboe. This marks the beginning of the relationship between Father Gabriel and the Guaraní natives.
Several orchestras have performed ""Gabriel's Oboe"", often under the direction of Morricone himself. The most famous renditions of the piece, other than in the movie, are probably those found in the Morricone Conducts Morricone series of concerts during the mid-2000s.
Keith and Kristyn Getty incorporated the song and blended it with their own verses with lyrics in their 2012 release ""Hymns for the Christian Life"" on track 12 ""Holy Spirit (with Gabriel's Oboe).""

About The Mission, 1986 film (source: Wikipedia)

54nxTqUBxJ4,Joe Dante on TOMB OF LIGEIA,"Roger Corman bids farewell to his Edgar Allan Poe series with a beautifully mounted departure from the heavy stylization of previous entries, played more like a gothic romance. Vincent Price would go on to top line an eccentric collection of further Poe ""adaptations"", some of them in name only.  Elizabeth Shepherd is a strong proto-Jane Austin heroine, and also plays Price's dead wife who haunts him from the grave in the form of a black cat. It's an intelligent and satisfying climax to the Corman/Poe saga.

IDtepG8EvHE,Monty Python's And Now For Something Completely Different (Theatrical Trailer),"The Best of Monty Python's Flying Circus

England was such a proper place - until the day the Python arrived. Monty Python, that is, a Flying Circus that slithered up the funnybone of an entire nation and gave it fits of laughter.


Here's Monty Python's first feature film - a hilarious collection of their very best twits, skits and bits from their popular TV series. There's ""Hell's Grannies"" and ""The Cannibal Baby Strollers,"" ""The Dead Parrot"" routine (he's just resting!) and valuable tips on how to defend yourself against an attacker armed with a piece of fruit. And who will ever forget ""The Lumberjack Song"" (""I cut down trees, I wear high heels, suspenders and a bra..."")?

And, of course, plenty of zany Monty Python animation. Absolutely the silliest stuff since the day Ernest Scribbler wrote the world's funniest joke and died (croak!) laughing.

MPAA Rated PG for suggestive humor, nude images, some mild language and violence.

However, as the severity of the wounds increases, Kiernan realises Frankie has become the vessel for an extraordinary and provocative message that threatens the very foundations of the Catholic Church, and now the stigmata is not the only thing threatening her life.  

Also starring Jonathan Pryce in a supporting role and featuring a fantastic cutting-edge score by The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan and Elia Cmíral, Stigmata is a visually stunning, intelligent supernatural horror

Two men, a unique friendship, a violent world. Danny (Stephen Graham from ""Snatch"", ""Broadwalk Empire"") is a scruffy small-time chancer, small in stature, but with a sharp eye for a scam. Joseph (Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is a giant of a man, but with the mental age of a seven-year-old and gentle as a lamb despite his extraordinary strength. Living together in their scuzzy inner-city flat, this odd-couple are opposites who can't live without each other: they pull petty thefts, go fishing and drink beer. They've been friends for years -- but their relationship is about to be pushed to the limit.

Coming in Feb 2012 - Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Download
Starring: Stephen Graham, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, David O'Hara (""The Departed""), Maxine Peake

Cary Grant followed up his successful role in GUNGA DIN with another signature performance, his edgiest to date, in one of the finest entries in the magical movie year of 1939. It was the second of five films he would make with director Howard Hawks. Famous as the supposed origin of the oft-quoted Cary Grant impersonation line ""Judy, Judy, Judy"", one of the best-known lines never actually spoken in a movie.

Ann-Margret drunkenly cavorting in a cascade of baked beans, Tommy is the
movie you've been waiting for. The Who's brilliant rock opera is sublimely
matched by director Ken Russell's penchant for cinematic excess during the
peak of his filmmaking audacity. Tommy revolves around the 'deaf, dumb, and
blind kid' (Roger Daltrey) who survives the childhood trauma that stole his
senses to become a Pinball Wizard in Pete Townshend's grandiose attack on
the hypocrisy of organised religion. Tommy's odyssey is rendered through
wall-to-wall music, from the bloodstream shock of Tina Turner to Elton John's
towering rendition of 'Pinball Wizard' and Daltrey's epiphanous rendition of
'I'm Free'. Other star performers include Eric Clapton and the Who's drummer
Keith Moon in this classic of creative rock cinema.

AdKxPTgo-Qw,Return to Honor Trailer,"This project, twelve months in the making, is dedicated to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces as they defend our freedoms we are able to enjoy today.
When our men and women of the Armed Forces return home from combat, they are faced with many challenges, especially those with debilitating injuries, both physically and mentally. We as a Nation, support these men and women, and it is our belief that bringing honor to these American Heroes, in fact promotes healing. 
This documentary captures the unprecedented effort displayed by an organization called Warrior's Weekend of Victoria, Texas. The determination of hundreds, if not thousands of patriots from the cities of Houston and Victoria as well as other surrounding towns, is manifest in this documentary and displays their dedication and loyalty to our country and appreciation to those who serve in the military.
We have captured the blood, sweat and tears that have been shed as over 350 wounded soldiers are brought to Victoria and then on to Port O'Connor, Texas from all over the United States.
Warrior's Weekend has created a most dynamic, ""rock star"" environment as these true American heroes get a good dose of Texas hospitality. From the moment their planes land in Houston, or they board a chartered bus at Brooke Army Medical Center or Fort Hood, these men and women are overwhelmed by just how many people honor their service and sacrifice. They are greeted at Faith Family Church by local schools and several hundred more patriots. After refreshments and a quick welcome ceremony, the soldiers are led to the Field of Honor which has over 2,500 large American flags. Each flag represents an individual soldier that local businesses and individuals have purchased.  The flags also bear the names of soldiers that are currently serving or commemorate those who have served our country.  As the service men and women arrive at Port O'Connor, Texas, they are just as captivated at the sight of the highway lined with people and hundreds of American flags being flown to welcome them. Then on to the fishing docks!  There they find 226 fishing vessels set to idle as the boat captains anxiously await the arrival of their American hero. The fishermen help the soldiers board the craft and then off they go to retrieve their bounty. 
In conjunction with a weekend to be remembered by all, I believe this documentary will touch the hearts and lives of all who see it and restore the importance of honoring those who serve this wonderful country we call America.",5081,23,4,282,0,0.7906

6ldXWxN6gZs,Allan Arkush on THE LADY EVE,"Preston Sturges’ screwball masterpiece is typical for the director, mixing outlandish slapstick with colorful characters and outrageous plot twists worthy of Mark Twain and Voltaire. There’s a touch of melancholy about the duplicitous romance between Barbara Stanwyck’s luscious but two-faced card shark and Henry Fonda’s hopelessly naive beer magnate but it’s mitigated by another stellar Sturges supporting cast including the magnificent William Demarest who has the (literal) last word: “Positively the same dame!”

Scheider’s innate good humor alleviates his character’s darker inclinations adding up to a memorable portrait of a charismatic megalomaniac.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) is not impressed with the RoboCop 2 prototypes.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The serialized story structure and barbed social commentary from comic book creator and co-writer Frank Miller earned critical respect in this satirical science fiction sequel directed by Irvin Kershner. Peter Weller returns as RoboCop, a futuristic cyborg fashioned from cutting-edge technology and the biological remains of slain Detroit police officer, Alex Murphy. Still patrolling the city streets, RoboCop is scheduled by his creator, Omni Consumer Products, to be replaced by a new ""superior"" model, RoboCop 2, that according to designer Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer), will contain the human remains not of a cop but a criminal. In the meantime, an instantly addictive drug called Nuke is sweeping through Detroit thanks to a kingpin named Cain (Tom Noonan). Taking Cain to task, RoboCop is captured and dismantled. When he's put back together, the cyborg is reprogrammed with a series of socially conscious commands (in a sly mocking of the then relatively new concept of ""political correctness"") that render him impotent as a law enforcer. Taking charge by rewiring himself with an electrical overload, RoboCop arrests Cain, who is injured in the process. Faxx secretly takes Cain's brain and inserts it into RoboCop 2, turning the robot immediately into a law-breaking murder machine and leading to a violent showdown between two generations of robotic crime-fighters.

wLJ8Z3PDEGU,Re-Animator (1985) Trailer,"Adapted from H.P. Lovecraft’s sepulchral 1922 pulp horror story, arguably the first such tale to ever consider scientifically affected corpses as zombies, Re-Animator is Stuart Gordon’s cult classic trip into the realm of the living dead.

Conducting clandestine experiments within the morgue at Miskatonic University, scientist Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs, From Beyond) reveals to fellow graduate student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) his groundbreaking work concerning the re-animation of fresh corpses. West’s secret reagent is a powerful injection with the capacity to give life where there is none – destined to capture the imagination of the entire scientific community. However, between life and death is a thin thread of understanding and when obsession gets the better of West, there is no stopping his wicked ways – dead or alive!

Presented complete and uncut in gore-glistening HD with all-new special features, Re-Animator is a true horror-fest of mortal manipulation in the most demented sense.

Intercepted Japanese messages warn of it - but never reach F.D.R.'s desk. Radar warnings are disregarded. Even the entrapment of a Japanese submarine in Pearl Harbor before the attack goes unreported. Ultimately the Day of Infamy arrives - in the most spectacular, gut-wrenching cavalcade of action-packed footage ever. You'll see moments of unsurpassed spectacle and heroism: U.S. fighters trying to take off and being hit as they taxi; men blasted from the decks of torpedoed ships while trying to rescue buddies; savage aerial dogfights pitting lone American fliers against squadrons of Imperial war planes.

MLlGZQkU3ak,The Effect of Gamma Rays 1972,"Paul Zindel hatvanas évek közepén kelt színjátékának  a maga idejében a Broadwayn volt nagy sikere. Az 1972-es moziváltozat  a hetvennégyes Mikulás meghozta a pesti mozikba is.
A Gamma-sugarak emlékezetesen ""családi film"", a szó minden lehetséges értelmében, melyek közül a kevésbé érdekes, de aligha elhagyható, hogy a rendezõ (Paul Newman) a mû döntõ szerepeit feleségére és lányára bízta. Ám családi film abban a tekintetben is, hogy a családról, adott esetben egy megcsonkult családról szól. A Joanne Woodward játszta megözvegyült anya, Beatrice két lánygyermekével és a körülötte lévõ világgal küzd, jobbára  álmaiba menekülve. 
Az egyik lánya epilepsziás, a másik magával van elfoglalva - ami egyben a mû kulcsa is, hisz az emberek viselkedése is megjelenik éppenséggel a virágkép(let)ekben. Voltaképpen nem is az érdekes, hogy mi lesz Beatrice családjával, hanem az, hogyan látja õket a rendezõ.
Egy alapvetõen szomorú és gyakorlatilag kilátástalan alapszituáció jelenik meg a vásznon, tagadhatatlanul vidám, illetve vidámító körülmények között, az elbeszélés és az elõadás határozott törekvései szerint. És ráadásnak az sem egy utolsó mulatság, ha Newman második rendezését összehasonlítjuk Robert Redford elsõ rendezésével, az Átlagemberekkel.
Az elbeszélés és az előadás határozott törekvései szerint megoldást keres, kérdéseket tesz fel és válaszol meg a szeretet (mint gamma-sugár) virágot (mint reményt) fakasztó potenciájáról.

„Ha majd a sugárzást jobban megértjük, eljön egy nap, amikor az atomrobbanásból keletkező erő megváltoztatja egész eddig ismert világunkat. És ezek nagyszerű változások lesznek; álmainkat meghaladó, csodálatos dolgok, és én azt hiszem, egész lelkemmel hiszem, eljön a nap, amikor a hálás emberiség köszönetet mond Istennek a csodálatos áldást hozó atomenergiáért.""

One day Helen and her boyfriend Michael (Ian Hendry) go off on holiday together and Carol is left alone in the empty apartment. Extremely paranoid, Carol refuses to let anyone in and never leaves the building herself, in effect breaking off all contact with the outside world.

Irma la Douce Trailer - Directed by Billy Wilder and starring Jack Lemmon, Jack Lemmon, Lou Jacobi, Bruce Yarnell, Herschel Bernardi. Irma la Douce is a 1963 comedy starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, directed by Billy Wilder. Though the film is not a musical, it won AndrÉ Previn an Academy Award for Best Score Adaptation or Treatment. There is also a scene in the film, in which Shirley MacLaine exclaims ""Dis-donc!"" whilst dancing on a table, which appears to be a deliberate tribute to the musical from which the film is derived. The film was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Shirley MacLaine) and Best Cinematography, Color.

At 10, Fanny Price, a poor relation, goes to live at Mansfield Park, the estate of her aunt's husband, Sir Thomas. Clever, studious, and a writer with an ironic imagination and fine moral compass, she becomes especially close to Edmund, Thomas's younger son. Fanny is soon possessed of beauty as well as a keen mind and comes to the attention of a neighbor, Henry Crawford. Thomas promotes this match, but to his displeasure, Fanny has a mind of her own, asking Henry to prove himself worthy. As Edmund courts Henry's sister and as light shines on the link between Thomas's fortunes and New World slavery, Fanny must assess Henry's character and assert her heart as well as her wit.

When Mr. Miles (Peter Cushing)introduces her to American writer Maurice Bendrix (Van Johnson) at one of the couple's cocktail parties, she is unable to deny her attraction to him, or to resist his interest in her. Almost as quickly as the two become deeply involved, spinning their dreams into plans for a long future together, Sarah mysteriously brings their affair to an end.

Very, very funny with an undertone of seriousness that catches up to the main characters by the end of the film.  Nicholson is fantastic, as usual, but it's one of his smaller films that was immediately overshadowed by ""Chinatown"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest"" that followed in the next two years, respectively.  At the time of the film's release, it was a huge success and Nicholson's performance was regarded highly.  Columbia then pulled the film from release, rereleasing it closer to Oscar time, but any buzz that had been generated had worn off by that time.  Still, Nicholson was nominated as was Robert Towne, the great screenwriter, and Randy Quaid for Best Supporting Actor.  Based on the novel by Darryl Ponicsan.

QxNWzbM7BjA,American Flyers - Trailer,"American Flyers takes you on the road for exciting world-class cycling competition as two brothers struggle to win a race and to regain the respect and affection they once shared. Achievement-oriented Marcus (Kevin Costner) is a nationally-ranked cyclist. Younger brother David (David Grant) is a drifter, content to cruise through life on a 10-speed. Time-and the painful events surrounding their father's death-have turned the siblings' differences into an open rift. So they try to bridge the gap by competing together in the Hell of the West, a grueling race through the Rocky Mountains. For the first time ever, the brothers train and race side-by-side...while each privately confronts a nagging fear: the congenital ailment that struck down their father could just suddenly strike one of them. Writer Steve Tesich, and Academy Award winner for his bike-racing opus Breaking Away, now captures the sport's excitement on an even larger scale. Against the backdrop of the Coors International Classic, the U.S.'s largest, most prestigious race, Tesich and director John Badham craft a dazzling, spirit-soaring spectacle. Says Rex Reed: ""You'll go away feeling good! American Flyers is a fine mixture of romance, humor and tears with action sequences among the most exciting ever captured on film.""

Successful mystery novelist Janet Frobisher, who has been separated for years from her husband, a man with a criminal past, lives in an isolated home in England.

HOWARDS END - 2016 4k Restoration
Directed by James Ivory
Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
Starring Anthony Hopkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson

One of Merchant Ivory’s undisputed masterpieces, this adaptation of E.M. Forster’s classic 1910 novel is a saga of class relations and changing times in Edwardian England. Margaret Schlegel (Emma Thompson) and her sister Helen (Helena Bonham Carter) become involved with two couples: a wealthy, conservative industrialist (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife (Vanessa Redgrave), and a working-class man (Samuel West) and his mistress (Niccola Duffet). The interwoven fates and misfortunes of these three families and the diverging trajectories of the two sisters’ lives are connected to the ownership of Howards End, a beloved country home. A compelling, brilliantly acted study of one woman’s struggle to maintain her ideals and integrity in the face of Edwardian society’s moribund conformist values.

Howards End is part of the Merchant Ivory library of films.",305174,1118,81,142,0,0.3556254545454545

It is the third movie adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1937 novel of the same name. The first adaptation was made in 1939, and a made-for-TV movie version was produced in 1981. It was released on October 2, 1992 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures.

George Milton (Gary Sinise) is in a train boxcar, reminiscing upon the events that have just happened. He thinks back to when he and his companion Lennie Small (John Malkovich), who has learning difficulties and the mentality of a small child, are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed. They were run out of town after Lennie was accused of attempted rape when he touched and held onto a young woman's pretty dress (prompted by his love of stroking soft things). After running from Weed, George and Lennie are trying to attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream, which he never tires of hearing George describe, is merely to have soft rabbits on the farm, which he can pet. The two go to work at a ranch named Tyler Ranch.

At the ranch, the dream appears to move closer to reality. Candy (Ray Walston), the aged, one-handed ranch-hand, offers to pitch in with Lennie and George so they can buy the farm. The dream disappears when Lennie accidentally kills the young and attractive wife (Sherilyn Fenn) of Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the ranch owner's son, while trying to stroke her hair. A lynch mob led by Curley gathers. Realizing he is doomed to a life of loneliness and despair like the rest of the migrant workers, and wanting to spare Lennie a painful death at the hands of the vengeful and violent Curley, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head before the mob can find him. The film comes to a close with the opening scene of George reminiscing in the train boxcar. The last minute of the movie depicts another memory: George and Lennie working together.",419379,822,373,143,0,0.151198

Disgusted with the inauthenticity of common society, Richard treks across Asia while avoiding all tourist settings at all costs.  In a shoddy Bangkok hotel, Richard meets a man who appears to be insane and calls himself Daffy.  Daffy tells Richard of a paradise unlike any other; a paradise in its purest form, untouched by humans exploiting nature.  When Richard awakens to find a crudely drawn map and that Daffy had killed himself, he decides to embark on a journey to find this paradise lagoon.  The Beach features a strong isolated island atmosphere and plenty of gorgeous scenery and backdrops.  The plot starts somewhat like an adventure romance but becomes increasingly more unorthodox until a climatic ending that breaks any stereotype it may have set earlier in the movie.

A-R9PysOaxI,Byrd's First Antarctic Expedition 1928,"Byrd Antarctic Expedition 1928. Richard E. Byrd

""In 1928, Admiral Byrd began his first expedition to the Antarctic involving two ships, and three airplanes: Byrd's Flagship was The City of New York; a Ford Trimotor called the Floyd Bennett (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd's previous expeditions); a Fairchild FC-2W2, NX8006, built 1928, named ""Stars And Stripes"" (now displayed at the Virginia Aviation Museum, on loan from the National Air and Space Museum); and a Fokker Universal monoplane called the Virginia (Byrd's birth state). A base camp named ""Little America"" was constructed on the Ross Ice Shelf and scientific expeditions by snowshoe, dog-sled, snowmobile, and airplane began. Photographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on 28 November 1929, the famous flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot Bernt Balchen, co-pilot/radioman Harold June, and photographer Ashley McKinley, flew the Ford Trimotor to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau. However, the flight was successful, and it entered Byrd into the history books. After a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on 18 June 1930. A 19 year-old American Boy Scout, Paul Allman Siple, was chosen to accompany the expedition. Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the American Geographical Society. This was also seen in the 1930 film With Byrd at the South Pole in which it covered his trip there.
Byrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931--1935) of Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society in the social sciences. In 1928, he carried the Society's flag during a historic expedition to the Antarctic to dramatize the spirit of adventure into the unknown, characterizing both the natural and social sciences""

The movie documents the Apollo missions - perhaps the most definitively of any movie under two hours. Al Reinert watched all the footage shot during the missions--over 6,000,000 feet of it, and picked out the best. Instead of being a newsy, fact-filled documentary, Reinart focuses on the human aspects of the space flights. The only voices heard in the film are the voices of the astronauts and mission control. Reinart uses the astronaunts' own words from interviews and from the mission footage. The score by Brian Eno underscores the strangeness, wonder, and and beauty of the astronauts' experiences--experiences which they were privileged to have for a first time ""for all mankind.""

This is the second film directed by the great Carroll Ballard. Like his first film, ""The Black Stallion"" (1979), it also deals with themes of isolation and human/animal relationships. Utilizing stunning cinematography and music, this is a grand adventure in the far north. Based on Farley Mowat's semi-autobiography of the same name, it tells about a man sent to uncover the reason behind the decline of caribou herds.

8EIFTAY4Tf8,Devil's Brigade Theatrical Movie Trailer (1968),"The Devil's Briaged takes place during World War II as a special fighting unit is formed combining a crack Canadian outfit and a conglomeration of US Army misfits previously serving time in military jails. After an initial period of conflict between the two groups, their enmity turns to respect and friendship and the unit is sent Italy to attempt a dangerous mission which has heretofore been considered impossible to successfully complete. The Canadians are the best that the Canadian army has to offer: spit and polish, multi-skilled and all experienced soldiers. The Americans are the dregs of the US Army: misfits and troublemakers lacking any kind of discipline. Over time, Frederick forges a unified, highly competent fighting force. Initially trained for a commando operation in Norway, Frederick has to move quickly to keep the unit together after the operation is canceled. They are sent to Italy where they distinguished themselves in numerous battles.",111324,300,35,225,0,0.1939607142857143

1_I4WgBfETc,Red Dawn Trailer (1984),"Trailer for the 1984 classic Red Dawn.  Avenge Me, WOLVERINES!

It is the dawn of World War III. In mid-western America, a group of teenagers bands together to defend their town, and their country, from invading Soviet forces.

From out of the sky, Soviet, Nicaraguan, and Cuban troops begin landing on the football field of a Colorado high school. In seconds, the paratroopers have attacked the school and sent a group of teenagers fleeing into the mountains. Armed only with hunting rifles, pistols, and bows and arrows, the teens struggle to survive the bitter winter and the Soviet KGB patrols hunting for them. Eventually, trouble arises when they kill a group of Soviet soldiers on patrol in the highlands. Soon they will wage their own guerrilla warfare against the invading Soviet troops-under the banner of 'Wolverines!'

Starring Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Powers Boothe, Harry Dean Stanton. Directed by John Milius.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Longtime neighbors and rivals John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) chase after the same woman (Ann-Margret).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This cheerful holiday comedy, a surprise box office smash, featured a generous dollop of raunchy, crude humor and was greatly elevated by the presence of masterful performers in the lead roles. Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile.

0km5zKJhxXI,Blood and Sand Trailer,"""Blood and Sand"" stars a ravishing Sharon Stone in a memorable pre-""Basic Instinct"" vamp role.
Previously filmed in 1922 featuring Rudolph Valentino and in 1940 with Tyrone Power, Vicente Blasco Ibanez's mystical bullfight novel Blood & Sand was given a third big-screen treatment in this 1989 Jose Frade Spanish production. In addition to Stone, it casts American actor Christopher Rydell as the bullfighter hero Juan Gallardo. Her role was previously essayed in 1922 by Nita Naldi and in 1940 by Rita Hayworth. The story remains the same: a dirt-poor youth rises to fame and fortune in the bull ring, forgets his roots, cheats on his wife, has a last-minute change of heart, and pays for his sins in grotesque fashion.
The story revolves around the young, talented, and naturally gifted torero Juan Gallardo. Gallardo wants to be popular in bull fighting. His love Carmen has a cousin who has left home with Gallardo for a bullfighting competition. After a bull charges the neophyte Gallardo, his friend intercepts and saves Gallardo at the cost of his own life.
A despondent Gallardo runs away and meets Lady Dona Sol (played by Stone), a beautiful, rich lady, who offers him a job to work her fields. However, Gallardo insists on becoming a superstar in bull fighting in his country, and, on the advice of a security guard, he joins the famous bull fighting trainer, Nacional. Nacional trains and prepares Gallardo for competition.

zF5b11vIcZ0,Wonderful scene from Dersu Uzala (1975),"Dersu Uzala is often considered to be one of Kurosawa's finest films, and should be a must see for any dedicated movie-goer. The film holds many of Kurosawa's hallmarks as a director: Thoughts on everyday life, subtle philosophy brewing underneath, great cinematography and camerawork, long shots, and of course plenty of wind!

This scene is probably the most memorable from the film. The captain and his guide, Dersu, find themselves separated from the rest of their men and lost in the deep Siberian tundra. There, in order to survive, they have to build a shelter of straw before the night falls over the land. It is a breathtaking (literally) scene, with a lot more quality than any Spielberg or Bay-movie that tend to crowd the cinemas nowadays.

I'm sorry about the video quality, it could have been a lot better. I hope though that you'll manage to enjoy the view anyhow! It actually turns out quite good in fullscreen. Also there are no subtitles to this, so delight in the atmosphere and beauty instead. ;)",72532,357,40,597,0,0.24878709677419356

One of the victims, a college student, thinks she has arrived in the village to do research on witchcraft.  Little does she know.  Creepy and atmospheric with a terrific climax that still packs a punch. A minor classic with a major following that's easily one of Lee's best. We offer an outstanding video edition of this terrifying film.  78 minutes.  From 35mm.

wnrqC8-YCDE,LA BAMBA 30th Anniversary Dual Format Trailer,"Born to Poverty. Destined for Stardom.  He lived the American Dream.

The life of rock & roll legend Ritchie Valens bursts across the screen in the highly celebrated music-filled biopic La Bamba, starring Lou Diamond Phillips (Young Guns, Che) as the teenage sensation whose rise to fame was tragically cut short at the age of 17.

Phillips gives an electrifying performance as Valens, who has to contend with racial prejudice, a jealous brother (a stunningly intense Esai Morales, NYPD Blue, Caprica) and an overbearing mother, before his unique style of Latino-influenced rock & roll rockets him to fame, but sets him on the path for an unavoidable date with destiny. 

Featuring music from Grammy Award winning rock band Los Lobos, and also starring Elizabeth Peña (Jacob’s Ladder, Down and Out in Beverly Hills), director Luis Valdez’s La Bamba is an irresistibly toe-tapping depiction of the early days of American rock music, and the indelible influence one young man had upon it. Eureka Entertainment is proud to present the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK in a 30th Anniversary Digitally Restored Dual Format Edition.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
While the team trains, Phillip Elliot (Nick Nolte) and Seth Maxwell (Mac Davis) train there liver and lungs by drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In a society in which major league sporting events have replaced Sunday worship as the religion of choice, North Dallas Forty appears like a desecration at the altar. In this film, directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz), the National Football League is revealed to be more about the money than the game. Nick Nolte is North Dallas Bulls pass-catcher Phillip Elliott, whose cynicism and independent spirit is looked upon as troublesome by team coaches Johnson (Charles Durning) and Strothers (G.D. Spradlin) and team owner Conrad Hunter (Steve Forrest). Elliot, at the end of his career and wise to the way players are bought and sold like cattle, goes through the games pumped up on painkillers conveniently provided by the management. His teammates include savvy quarterback Maxwell (Mac Davis) and lunk-headed defensive lineman Jo Bob Priddy (Bo Svenson), who deal with the impersonality and back-biting of the game through off-field diversions. When the Bulls management benches Elliot after manipulating him to help train a fellow teammate, Elliot has to decide whether there is more to life than the game that he loves.

However, what he does not realize is that changing history has triggered a new set of tragic events, including the murder of his mother.

Ho6FFhtTfkI,FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE(1978) Original Theatrical Trailer,"Inspired by and intended as a sequel to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE(1961), this WW 2 action movie is often cited by critics as a lackluster and a poor sequel. If given a fair chance, it is very enjoyable, and features great acting, production, and a good plot overall. Robert Shaw and Harrison Ford have co-starring leads, with Ford being fresh from the role that made him a household name--Han Solo in STAR WARS. Ford portrays American Ranger Lt. Col. Mike Barnsby, the leader of a commando unit sent to Yugoslavia to destroy a vital bridge that will allow Nazi forces to move into Partisan territory. Shaw's character is Major Mallory, who joins Barnsby's unit but has a mission of his own: seek out and elminate a double agent operating with the Yugoslavian resistance fighters. This movie is also of note because it marked Robert Shaw's final film appearance. He died of a heart attack shortly after finishing the project.

Phtnr5QeiZ4,John Landis on CABARET,"They say tense sets often make for good movies and Cabaret is no exception. Desperate for a hit after the flop of Sweet Charity, director Bob Fosse rode herd on the cast, especially Joel Grey, who originated the role of the creepy Kit Kat Klub emcee on Broadway but almost lost his Oscar-winning part in the movie to Fosse’s initial choice… Ruth Gordon. At one point Fosse spitefully reduced all Grey’s musical numbers to snippets (the producers put it all back). The finished movie won eight Oscars including Best Director for Fosse and Best Actress for star Liza Minnelli, who never had a better role. Christopher Isherwood’s “Berlin Stories”, which introduced the character of Sally Bowles, had been filmed as a straight drama in 1955 under the title I Am a Camera.

Held Up (1999) Official Trailer #1 - Jamie Foxx Movie HD

While they're on vacation in the Southwest, Rae finds out her man Michael spent their house money on a classic car, so she dumps him, hitching a ride to Vegas for a flight home. A kid promptly steals Michael's car, leaving him at the Zip & Sip, a convenience store. Three bumbling robbers promptly stage a hold up. Two take off with the cash stranding the third, with a mysterious crate, just as the cops arrive. The robber takes the store hostage. As incompetent cops bring in a SWAT team and try a by-the-book rescue, Michael has to keep the robber calm, find out what's in the crate, aid the negotiations, and get back to Rae. The Stockholm Syndrome asserts its effect.

A less drastic tack is taken by the heroes of Bruce Kessler's drive-in situation comedy: they pretend to be gay, and have to keep up the pretense while trying to date girls on the side. The expected stereotypes abound, but all looks pretty goofy and innocuous today. Some in the LGBT community consider it progressive for its time. A bikini-clad Candice Rialson can be glimpsed in a bit part on her way to B-movie stardom.

S5175bV18MM,Original Theatrical Trailer | Gypsy | Warner Archive,"Gypsy (1962) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #Gypsy

Ringing with the showbiz sass of its Jule Styne/Stephen Sondheim score, the film version of the Broadway hit Gypsy takes you on a grand vaudeville tour. It sweeps you up in the roller-coaster relationship of Louise (Natalie Wood), the wallflower later to blossom into sophisticated stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, and her ambitious mother, Rose (Rosalind Russell who's performance won her a fifth Best Actress Golden Globe Award). Karl Malden scores as Herbie, the salesman who falls for Rose - to his exasperation. Full of terrific tunes (Everything's Coming Up Roses and Small World among them), Gypsy will certainly entertain you and definitely make you smile.

Special Features: 2 Outtake Musical Numbers: You'll Never Get Away from Me (Duet Version) and Together Wherever We Go.

Directed By Mervyn LeRoy
Starring Rosalind Russell, Natalie Wood, Karl Malden

Directed and written by Barbara Sonneborn
Featuring Xuan Ngoc Nguyen, Barbara Sonneborn

""The cumulative effect of superbly integrated interviews and archival footage is staggering, easily as terrifying as anything found in Saving Private Ryan...wisely allows the ravaged faces and grainy footage of dead children to speak for themselves.""   
— Variety

Regret to Inform superbly portrays the lasting devastation of the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of women, both American and Vietnamese, who lost their husbands. This is the story of one woman's journey to Vietnam, twenty years after her husband was killed there, and the women she encounters who were affected by the war.

READ MORE....

Hoping to find some closure for her pain and loss, Barbara Sonneborn wants to see and feel the places where her husband spent his last days. By intercutting emotional testimonials from women on both sides of the war who share their suffering, she makes us understand how real this war remains. Through seeing many different women's perspectives, we recognize how their emotions contrasted: helplessness on the part of those in the United States versus inevitable participation by North and South Vietnamese women.

A very powerful, yet quiet, film, Regret to Inform develops a yet-unseen perspective: that of those left behind. Focused on Vietnamese and American women, the film is filled with exceptional interviews which are revealing and poignant. Testimony to Sonneborn 's uncommon ability is the remarkable level of honesty and openness the women are willing to share on camera. The viewer is taken on an uncommonly well-crafted journey, which includes beautiful camerawork and a seamless mixture of new and archival footage. Deeply personal and vastly universal, Regret to Inform is an involving and moving lesson about the painful legacy of war.

REVIEWS

""Regret To Inform may claim an unusual point of view, but the anguish it uncovers is familiar from numerous previous accounts of the war. That it's the same tragic story however you come at it may in fact be the most enlightening aspect of this film.""   — Village Voice

""While recognizing that war has its heroic aspect - witness the fortitude and resilience of the widows - [Regret to Inform] also implies that the terrible price of that nobility is one that nobody should have to pay.""  — New York Times

""Unlike the traditional documentary that seeks to impart information and keep emotion largely in check, Regret to Inform is frankly personal and explicitly emotional.""  — San Francisco Chronicle

It sounds so simple, yet in 1966 a young filmmaker named Bruce Brown captured the essence of a sport as never before. To stand atop a crescendo of water, to ride on nature's all powerful wave feeling the speed and spray accelerate with each moment, and to embrace a lifestyle uniquely connected to a single word: surfing. The film was THE ENDLESS SUMMER. Now, Bruce Brown and filmmaker son, Dana, have created an all new classic, featuring never-before-seen footage from THE ENDLESS SUMMER. Embark on a journey of adventure, discovery, and the incredible challenge of facing a fifteen foot wall of water as the sport's greatest surfers look back on the thrills, the spills, and the movie that uniquely embraced the lifelong search for that shining beach, that glowing sunset, that perfect wave.",859976,1558,79,84,0,0.24064827586206897

-WPxTWDEtAg,Karyn Kusama on NEAR DARK (Trailer Commentary),"For her second film, director Kathryn Bigelow's original intention had been to make a revisionist western, but when it became apparent nobody was funding horse operas in 1987 she and co-writer Eric Red decided to turn their project into a genre hybrid--a vampire western. Aside from Curse of the Undead (1959), Billy the Kid Meets Dracula and Jesse James vs. Frankenstein's Daughter (both 1966), that concept had been pretty much unexplored.  Box office returns were unexciting, but it found an appreciative audience on video. A modern remake co-written by Bigelow started shooting in 2007 but remains uncompleted, having been put on hold due to its similarity to the Twilight series.

Synopsis
For eight decades, Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 masterpiece has remained one of the most influential silent films of all time. This all-new restoration -- available for the first time in 35mm -- restores dozens of missing shots, all 146 title cards, and Edmund Meisel's definitive 1926 score, returning the film to a form as close to its creator's bold vision as has been seen since the film's triumphant Moscow premiere.

This film is totally out of control!

The original take-off cult classic from the highly successful team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker (Airplane, The Naked Gun), this ""uproariously funny [film]"" (TV Guide) launched a thousand laughs and serves as a precursor to the raunch-fests of the '80s and the blockbuster success of the Farrelly Brothers films. Directed by the legendary John Landis (Animal House, The Blues Brothers), The Kentucky Fried Movie features a lewd, loosely connected collection of skits that spoof blaxploitation films, news shows, porno movies, TV commercials, kung fu flicks and more!

Including well-known stars such as Bill Bixby, Donald Sutherland, Tony Dow, George Lazenby and Henry Gibson, this one-of-a-kind film features over 22 gut-bustingly hilarious segments including:

""Cleopatra Schwartz""
""The Wonderful World Of Sex""
""Catholic High School Girls In Trouble""
""A Fistful Of Yen""
And More!

The Kentucky Fried Movie -- uncensored, uncut and unapologetic!

The Department of Justice hires him to stage the murder of a gangster about to enter the Witness Protection Program. He agrees, but then things get complicated. Meanwhile, New York City police detective Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy) is investigating the faked murder and cannot understand why the Justice Department is even less helpful than usual. [1]

pSPje5KXj2E,"""On Our Merry Way"" -Stewart, Fonda & MacMurray","This was a real curio of a movie... James ""Slim"" Stewart and Henry Fonda were long time friends and roommates in NYC in their halcyon Broadway stage days, and here they are together in 1948 in a nearly forgotten little comedy called ""On Our Merry Way"", an episodic comedy tied together with Burgess Meredith's character playing a reporter doing a story about Children. In this scene Hank and Jimmy are musicians traveling with a ragtag band in a beat up old bus. Down on their luck they happen on an aspiring horn player (Played here by Carl ""alfalfa"" Switzer, who had a tiny role 2 years earlier with Jimmy Stewart in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as a  Mischeivous high school kid who opens up the dance floor to drop the dancing kids into the swimming pool~!)  
 
Here, Carl plays a young ""Hepcat"" who dreams of a life traveling with such a band. 
Dig his way-out rendition of ""You must have been a beautiful Baby"" as he plays along with the great Harry James. ""Beat me, Daddy!""
Stewart and Fonda are way too ""unhep"" to be real Jazz bohos, and it's still too early in 1948 to give much creedence to the new Jazz phenomenon called BeBop. They play a safe, watered down form of Swing. Yet, it is still a pleasure to see these real life pals onscreen together (in spite of their growing postwar political differences) at the young ages of 40 and 43. James Stewart would never seem this young again.
 
 
Here's another segment of the 1948 film that shows Fred MacMurray in an early comedic role along side his future TV costar in ""My Three Sons"", William Demarest, who would play Uncle Charlie 12 years later for the duration of the show (after a season with William Frawley, of course). Fred started out as a leading man only to discover he had a gift for light comedy. Look at his adroit handling of these magic tricks. Although MacMurray and Fonda starred together in their earliest roles, the Technicolor film, ""trail  of the Lonesome Pine"", it's too bad Fred and his real life friend James Stewart weren't in any scenes together in this one. Their's might have been a cinematic teaming that could have really thrived!

wZay5lGzWZg,"Richard Dreyfuss in ""Silent Fall"" 1994 Movie Trailer","Director Bruce Beresford makes a foray into the genre of psychological mystery with this film, which stars Richard Dreyfuss as psychologist Dr. Jake Rainer. The doctor has gone into retirement after the trauma of having an autistic child under his care commit suicide. 

Thus, when approached by local sheriff Michael Rivers (J.T. Walsh) with a request that he try to get through to an autistic nine-year-old boy Tim Warden (Ben Faulkner), who likely witnessed and possibly committed the double murder of his parents, he initially demurs. 

However, he puts aside his reservations after hearing that another psychologist, Dr. Harlinger (John Lithgow), intends to drug the boy into revealing the truth. When police entered the murder scene, they had found, along with the bloody victims, the boy brandishing a knife, and his teenaged sister Sylvie (Liv Tyler), cowering in the closet. 

Since the girl saw nothing, Rainer begins to work slowly and patiently with this boy who has never spoken, using a method based on the fact that the the autistic mind thinks in terms of rote sequences. He also gains the trust of the haunted Sylvie, and gradually the children unfold their tale of terror.

Mona also finds an unexpected supporter in her own, long-neglected daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), who, as the pageant looms closer, finally makes Mona realize where love and acceptance can truly be found. © 2000 Destination Films Distribution Company, Inc. and Flashpoint (UK) Ltd.

Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Chick (Bud Abbot) and Wilbur (Lou Costello) accidentally awaken Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolf Man.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
It seems that Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), in league with a beautiful but diabolical lady scientist (Lenore Aubert), needs a ""simple, pliable"" brain with which to reactivate Frankenstein's creature (Glenn Strange). The ""ideal"" brain belongs to the hapless Lou Costello, whom the lady doctor woos to gain his confidence and lure him to the operating table. Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), better known as the Wolf Man, arrives on the scene to warn Costello and his pal Bud Abbott of Dracula's nefarious schemes. Throughout the film, the timorous Costello witnesses the nocturnal rituals of Dracula and the Monster, but can't convince the ever-doubting Abbott--until the wild climax in Dracula's castle, where the comedians are pursued by all three of the film's monstrosities. As a bonus, the Invisible Man (voiced by an unbilled Vincent Price) shows up for ""all the excitement.""

The eponymous creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning in underwater scenes. The film was released in the United States on 5 March 1954.

Debbie Reynolds plays the title role, inviting all to Belly Up to the Bar, Boys for the whoop-and-holler film of Willson's 1960 Broadway hit. Reynolds won a 1964 Best Actress Oscar® nomination as the backwoods heroine who survives the Titanic and the snobbery of Denver society. Screen-debuting Harve Presnell reprises his stage role of Johnny, who has heartful-and-a-half of love for Molly. Johnny wasn't alone.

Before Night Falls (2000) Official Trailer - Javier Bardem, Johnny Depp Movie 

Episodic look at the life of Cuban poet and novelist, Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990), from his childhood in Oriente province to his death in New York City. He joins Castro's rebels. By 1964, he is in Havana. He meets the wealthy Pepe, an early lover; a love-hate relationship lasts for years. Openly gay behavior is a way to spite the government. His writing and homosexuality get him into trouble: he spends two years in prison, writing letters for other inmates and smuggling out a novel. He befriends Lázaro Gomes Garriles, with whom he lives stateless and in poverty in Manhattan after leaving Cuba in the Mariel boat-lift. When asked why he writes, he replies cheerfully, ""Revenge.""

With the goal of securing her promotion, Lily ventures into the most isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs and finds herself increasingly enchanted - not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the raw courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harshest conditions. It is not, however, until she meets Tom - a handsome, hardened war veteran and talented musician - that she's forced to examine her motivations.

The United States armed forces were at their highest state of readiness ever and Soviet field commanders in Cuba were prepared to use battlefield nuclear weapons to defend the island if it was invaded. Luckily, thanks to the bravery of two men, President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev, war was averted. 

The year is 1962. USAF U-2 spy planes discover that the USSR is placing nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba. The Chiefs of Staff warns President Kennedy and his cabinet that the missiles have the potential to kill up to 80 million Americans, and destroy a large number of USAF bomber bases, crippling the U.S. ability to retaliate and leaving the country an easy target for Soviet invasion. Fortunately, the missiles are not yet operational, and the President and his staff try to figure out how to get the missiles out of Cuba, whether by diplomatic means or by force.

Diane, the captain of the squad who is madly in love with Lincoln High star quarterback Jack Bartlett, has nuclear-powered enthusiasm. Hannah is righteously born-again. Kansas, the rebel whose mother is doing time in the local prison, can't help but talk trashy. Lucy is a geek obsessed with going to Harvard. And Cleo has fantasies of stalking Conan O'Brien. High school is mostly heaven for these paragons of teenage bliss - until Jack and Diane find themselves in an unexpected adult situation, and in desperate need of extra cash. In order to help their friend Diane, the A-Squad goes where no cheerleader has gone before: taking on a little after-school project known as bank robbery. But like five Bonnies without a Clyde, the A-Squad does things their way - with a little sugar and a lot of spice.

Ivan Reitman, producer of National Lampoon's Animal House and producer/director of Ghostbusters, brings you Big Shots, a slam-bang comedy-adventure with a heart as big as Chicago. It centers on the unlikely but very special friendship that develops between two 11-year-old boys. Obie is a kid from the lily-white suburbs struggling with the recent death of his father while Scam is a product of the inner city, streetwise but equally alone. Together they share an odyssey full of outrageous humor and riveting excitement that teaches them that it's character and love, note size, age or stature, that truly makes someone a big shot.

Robert Mandel, director of FIX, has give Big Shots a percolating rhythm that maintains a deft balance between the story's scares and surprises and its warm, knowing exploration of two boys on the brink of manhood. With a sterling supporting cast, this is a film the whole family will enjoy.

James Joyce's 1914 novella is considered one of the greatest stories ever written, yet Huston's meticulous movie does it full justice. Stately, elegant and richly observed, with a poignant climactic punch that sneaks up on you. Among the Abbey Players seen to advantage herein are Hollywood stalwarts Dan O'Herlihy and Sean McClory but It's Angelica Huston's movie to steal, and she does.

When some bad guys break into the lab to steal the technology, one of the scientists takes a syringe which contains the miniaturized Tuck and vessel. Now in the vessel is part of the material needed to restore him. But the other part which is the lab is stolen. The scientist's shot but before dying he injects Tuck into Jack Putter, a hypochondriac, who feels that something is wrong with him all the time. When Tuck links himself to Jack's systems, he discovers that something happened. So they go back to the lab, and discover what happened. Now they are told that unless they retrieve the material that was stolen they won't be able to restore Tuck before his oxygen is depleted. Now the government rep decides that the only thing that matters that as long as they have the other half of the material, it is useless to the thieves. So Tuck eggs Jack to go out and find the thieves. They enlist the aid of Tuck's old girlfriend, Lydia, who is a reporter. And it's fortunate for them that she has a lead that pans out.

WQDXfB1nBnk,JAWS: The Revenge Trailer HQ,"The only JTR Trailer in HQ on YouTube! 

PLOT:
The story returns to the Brody family in Amity Island. Martin Brody had died of a heart attack, although his widow, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), claims that ""it was the fear [of the shark] that killed him."" She discusses with her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), and his fiance Tiffany (Mary Smith), arrangements for the Christmas season. Now working as a police deputy in Amity, Sean is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy. As he does so, he is attacked by a shark. He is killed as his screams are drowned out by the carol singers on the island.
Ellen is convinced that the shark had deliberately targeted Sean due to some evil curse, and visits her eldest son, Michael (Lance Guest), in the Bahamas. Michael now works as a marine biologist. Fearing he will be attacked next by the shark, Ellen hopes to convince him to take up a new job on dry land. She meets Hoagie (Michael Caine), and they begin dating. Michael's wife Carla (Karen Young) is an artist and one day during her art exhibit, Ellen's granddaughter Thea (Judith Barsi) asks if she can go out on a banana boat with her friend Margaret and her mother (Diane Hetfield). The shark attacks the boat with Thea on it. The shark ends up devouring Margaret's mother in the process with blood flying everywhere, leaving Thea unharmed, but in a state of shock. Ellen becomes convinced that the shark has tracked her family to the Bahamas. She takes a boat out to sea on her own, intent on confronting and killing the shark to break the curse, or sacrificing herself hoping the shark will leave her family alone.


The shark leaps out of the water to attack Jake (Mario Van Peebles)
Hoagie flies Michael and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) out to sea so that they can find Ellen quickly. Hoagie lands the plane on the sea, but the shark sinks it. Looking out for the shark while using a device that emits electromagnetic impulses to drive the shark mad, Jake moves to the end of the prow. The shark unexpectedly leaps from the surface of the water to grab Jake, biting into him and dragging him beneath the surface in a gory fashion. The device causes the shark to repeatedly leap out of the water and Ellen steers the boat directly for the shark, impaling it on the broken bowsprit, which somehow causes it to explode. After killing the shark, they find Jake mauled but alive. Near the end of the film, Ellen is relieved that the curse of the shark is no longer on her family. The film ends as Hoagie flies Ellen back to Amity Island.",658133,695,325,65,0,0.018962000000000003

Can love bridge the gap between Earth and Heaven? Moviemakers have thought so for decades. And the pursuit of eternal bliss has never been so sly, engaging or magical as when Timothy Hutton and Kelly McGillis strike up a romance Made in Heaven. Deceased drifter Mike (Hutton) arrives in Heaven and quickly falls for newborn soul Annie (McGillis), soon to start her assignment on Earth. When Annie leaves, Mike follows, risking all to find her in her new identity with neither having memories of their previous celestial existence. Maureen Stapleton, Amanda Plummer and an array of star cameos highlight what director Alan Rudolph (Afterglow, Welcome to L.A.) calls a good old-fashioned fairy tale of destiny and love. Watch and feel like youre on Cloud Nine (Joel Siegel, Good Morning America/ABC-TV).

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Desmond (Martin Short) is thrilled when the opening number of his musical based on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" goes off without a hitch.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Ben Foster stars in this teenage comedy as Berke Landers, an average high schooler who has achieved high status by winning over Allison (Melissa Sagemiller), reputed to be the most popular and beautiful girl in his class. After an initially winning time, Allison finds herself drawn to the hot new guy in school, leaving Berke in the lurch. At the risk of ruining his unsteady reputation, Berke concocts a scheme for getting Allison back: he will join the school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream and prove his romanticism to her. Realizing he needs an effective acting coach, he turns to Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), who was once the annoying little sister of a best friend and has suddenly blossomed into a grownup -- to whom Berke finds himself drawn. Berke must then decide if getting Allison back is the ultimate priority, as he falls for the more sensible Kelly, all while trying to maintain a credible presence both in school and in his new acting gig. Get Over It also features R&B singer Sisqo, comedian Martin Short, and Shane West in supporting roles.

Behind bars for what could be a life sentence, Alex subjects himself to a solitary existence, his spirit crushed by the cramped prison cell. A terrible tension tightens every muscle in his body with a frustration equaled only by his father's rage. Both are ready to explode. There's one way out of prison for Alex, and that's in the hands of the parole board. But there is a way out of his self-imposed solitary with the help of a young woman he thought he'd never see again. It's something to live for. Something to die for.

hoLodMR6DAY,Les Feluettes / Lilies (1996) - Movie Trailer,"* Winner of the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture (aka the Canadian Oscars) 

One of the most successful gay indie films of the '90s, Lilies won four Canadian Genie Awards® (the equivalent of the American Oscars®) including Best Picture, and won critical acclaim worldwide. 

John Greyson's Lilies is an emotionally intense, suspense-laden tale of love, betrayal and revenge in which one man's past comes back to haunt him and another man's past comes to bring him freedom.

In 1952, Catholic Bishop Bilodeau (Marcel Sabourin, Sum of All Fears) makes an exceptional in-person visit to a prison to hear a dying inmate's last confession. Once in the confessional, the Bishop is confronted by his childhood friend, Simon (Aubert Pallascio, 3 Needles), who collaborates with his fellow inmates to take the Bishop hostage and re-enact Simon's version of the events that led to his murder conviction forty years earlier, in their rural village, of young Vallier.

This flashback story centers on two boys who are madly in love with each other. Young Simon (Jason Cadieux) and Vallier (Danny Gilmore) are cast in a school play about Caesar meeting St. Sebastian. And young Bilodeau, a closeted man secretly in love with Vallier, tries to be close to his love but sees Simon as an obstacle. The action moves back and forth, seamlessly through time, between the crude prison and the actual events of 1912, culminating in the tragic night when both men's fates are decided and their true love is lost forever.

More’s the pity because Wise’s film, about a machinist’s mate caught up in the Chinese civil war of 1926, is an ambitious attempt to examine both political and personal conflicts against an intriguing historical backdrop. Steve McQueen stars as the rebellious sailor alongside Richard Attenborough whose romance with a Chinese courtesan comes to a tragic end.

Back home, Henry confronts his unrequited passion for his high school best friend and his feelings about being gay in a small town. But, as we quickly learn, Big Eden residents defy the stereotype of ""small town, small minds."" 

As Henry works through his emotions, the townspeople quietly conspire to help him along, until Henry realizes new possibilities for both friendship and romance. 

""Big Eden"" is a uniquely American fable about home and family. It hits upon the universal longing and hope we each have for finding a place where we are loved, and the unconditional desire to see those that we love find happiness.",19231,66,1,173,0,0.8255

McKenzie is presented as the first and greatest innovator of modern cinema, single-handedly inventing the tracking shot (by accident), the close-up (unintentionally), and both sound and color film years before their historically documented creation. The film also shows fragments of an epic Biblical film supposedly made by McKenzie in a giant set in the forests of New Zealand, and a 'computer enhancement' of a McKenzie film providing clear evidence that New Zealander Richard Pearse was the first man to invent a powered aircraft, several months prior to the Wright Brothers.
The film also shows a (staged) premiere screening of a recovered McKenzie film presented by film promoter Lindsay Shelton.

mit Götz Gorge, Christian Redl, Jeanette Hain, Felix Eitner u.a.

Der großspurige, aber liebenswerte Zobel (Götz George), sein Lebenspartner Karl (Christian Redl) und Zobels Tochter Lizzi (Jeanette Hain) haben als Taschenräuber-Trio die besten Tage hinter sich. In ihrem klapprigen Wohnmobil fahren sie von Stadt zu Stadt, klauen und werden beklaut, streiten sich und wollen nicht wahrhaben, dass es so nicht weiter geht. 

Als Karl durch einen Verkehrsunfall ausfällt, tritt der junge, naive Rudolf in das Leben von Vater und Tochter -- und macht beiden schöne Augen. Verwicklungen, Konflikte und Enttäuschungen sind vorprogrammiert -- oder gibt es doch ein Happy-End für das Trio?

Für viele überraschend, besetzte Erfolgsregisseurin Hermine Huntgeburth die Rolle des schwulen Kleinganoven Zobel mit „Deutschlands Lieblings-Macho"" (Berliner Zeitung) Götz George. Mit ihm schuf sie, noch überraschender, eine völlig klischeefreie, bührende, originell erzählte Tragikkomödie über Menschen, die mit Charme, Herz und trockenem Witz ihr Leben am Rande der Gesellschaft meistern. Mittlerweile ist DAS TRIO ein Klassiker unter den deutschen Komödien der 1990er Jahre.

Tomb Raider was the first major Hollywood film to shoot in Cambodia since Peter O'Toole starred in Lord Jim in 1964. The Tomb Raider crew were all set to travel to China to film the Terracotta Army coming to life, when the sequence was pulled at the last minute, as it had already been featured in a Chinese movie. Cambodia was next on the list and Hanuman Films was chosen for scouting at Angkor. Following a successful scout with a full technical crew, Paramount British Pictures appointed Hanuman Films as their local servicing partner in the Kingdom of Cambodia.

Nick Ray worked as Location Manager on the film, selecting locations for the shoot, building a photographic inventory of the temples used in shooting, approving all sets or alterations to be made at each site and working with local authorities every step of the way to ensure this first sensitive shoot at Angkor passed without incident.
  
Hanuman Films also took responsibility for recruitment of extras, recruitment of site security, recruitment of humpers and labourers and recruitment of a large team of interpreters (some turned out to be more like interrupters, but most acquitted themselves well!). 

Tomb Raider premiered on June 15th 2001 at Mann's Theatre in Los Angeles. Nick and Kulikar were both invited to the premiere and stayed with Producer Lloyd Levin for a long weekend of partying.

DCBBm-zgWSo,Kenny G - Let It Snow! (1999),"""Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"", also known as ""Let It Snow"", is a song written by lyricist Sammy Cahn and composer Jule Styne in 1945. It was written in July 1945 in Hollywood, California during one of the hottest days on record.  First recorded by Vaughn Monroe, it became a popular hit, reaching number one on the Billboard music chart the following year.  Due to its seasonal lyrics, it is commonly regarded as a Christmas song. Yet despite its cheery, holiday feel, it is a love song that never mentions Christmas.

Oh the weather outside is frightful
 But the fire is so delightful
 And since we've no place to go
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

 It doesn't show signs of stopping
 And I've bought some corn for popping
 The lights are turned way down low
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

 When we finally kiss good night
 How I'll hate going out in the storm!
 But if you'll really hold me tight
 All the way home I'll be warm

 The fire is slowly dying
 And, my dear, we're still goodbying
 But as long as you love me so
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",519138,1188,27,192,0,0.3868304347826087
N-Ofhz9LUr0,Dennis Lehane on SEXY BEAST,"Jonathan Glazer’s pitch-black comedy, a parody of kinky, hard-bitten British gangster films in the vein of Performance and Get Carter, stormed the box office in 2000. Ben Kingsley’s spittle-flecked performance as the bloodthirsty sociopath Don Logan was based, in Kingsley’s own words, on his grandmother, who he described as a “vile and extremely unpleasant woman”.

N7eq_0cJXiI,Pandaemonium - John Hannah,"(2000) John Hannah stars as poet William Wordsworth, who collaborated with fellow poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Linus Roache) during a tumultuous period of political and romantic idealism. 

At first this works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend.

The film proceeds as a funny, quirky rom-com á la Howard Hawks’ Bringing Up Baby until the arrival of Griffith’s sociopathic ex-husband, played by Ray Liotta, when things take an abrupt turn toward the dark side. The movie’s eclectic soundtrack, a Demme trademark, reinforces the film’s roller coaster mood swings.

4clwgHEOYMo,X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (Trailer),"X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes is a 1963 science fiction/horror film. Directed by Roger Corman from a script by Ray Russell and Robert Dillon, the film stars Ray Milland as Dr. James Xavier. A world renowned scientist, Dr. Xavier experiments with X-ray vision and things go horribly wrong. While most of the cast are relatively unknown, Don Rickles is notable in an uncharacteristically dramatic role. Veteran character actor Morris Ankrum makes an uncredited appearance, his last in the movie industry.

Shot in a mere three weeks on an ultra-slim budget of $300,000, Corman described the film's success as a miracle. The movie was notable for its use of visual effects to portray Dr. Xavier's point of view. While crude by later standards, the visuals are still effective in impressing upon the audience the bizarre viewpoint of the protagonist.
