## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and the `pip` package manager installed. This project also uses Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rachit-bhatt/Social-Media-Analytics---Assignment.git
   cd Social-Media-Analytics-Assignment
2. **Install required packages:** All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. **Optional:** To use Jupyter Notebooks for analysis:
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter
  jupyter notebook
  ```
## Usage Guide

1. **Data Loading**:
   Place your raw data files into the `data/` directory. Scripts are configured to load data from this directory.

2. **Data Processing**:
   Run processing scripts in `scripts/` to clean and prepare data for analysis. Example:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_cleaning.py
3. **Analysis Notebooks:** Use the Jupyter Notebooks in `notebooks/` for in-depth, interactive analysis. Each notebook includes markdown annotations explaining each step of the analysis.

4. **Results & Visualization:** Visual outputs will be saved to the `results/` directory for reporting and interpretation.

## Analysis Techniques

This project utilizes several advanced analysis techniques:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using NLP models like VADER to classify sentiments based on post text, hashtags, and comments.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzing data across time intervals to identify patterns in engagement, popularity, and trends.
- **User Engagement Metrics**: Quantifying metrics like comment-to-like ratios and share rates for insights into content resonance.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create detailed visual reports, aiding in presentation and decision-making.
